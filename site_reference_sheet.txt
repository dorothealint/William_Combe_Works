    William Combe: A Textual Analysis
    Welcome to the Wiiiliam Combe Project! Here, we look into some works by author 
    William Combe!
        - Amelia's Letters: the missing names and places
        - Modern Spectator: compare the letter writers to the original Spectator and
            see how many are close to the original ideas
                - Stylometric Analysis of each letter portion to see if any/all were
                    written by Combe (and which ones weren't to eventually see if the
                    named writer exists in any available records)
