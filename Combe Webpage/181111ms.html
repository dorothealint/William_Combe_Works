               <p>It is ingeniously observed by an eminent moral as well as philosophical writer,
                  that comic playwrights exaggerate every character, and draw their fop or
                  spendthrift, their bully or sharper, their old maid or coquette, with stronger
                  features than are any where to be met with in nature. Indeed, this kind of
                  dramatic painting may be compared to pictures designed for domes and ceilings,
                  where, to produce their proper effect, the colours must be heightened, and the
                  forms of the figures enlarged beyond their natural appearance. Thus the objects of
                  the composition seem monstrous when seen too nigh, but acquire a due proportion
                  when examined in the precise view in which the painter designed them to be
                  surveyed. </p>
               <p>This kind of exaggeration, when applied to the stage, is, I think, to be allowed
                  only when the writer means not merely to describe a character, but a passion. In
                  the former it becomes him to keep close to his original, otherwise he launches
                  into caricature, and consequently gives impressions that deceive, instead of
                  affording instruction; but in the latter, where the vice or the folly in all its
                  tendencies and ramifications is compressed into one form, when, instead of
                  representing an individual as he is seen under the partial influence of any
                  predominant passion, the whole is condensed into one mind, and operates in all
                  possible directions, it is no longer a natural representation, because Nature
                  disdains such a compound: at the same time, when it is managed with skill, the
                  effect on the spectator may, in certain cases, be rendered very powerful in
                  producing moral instruction and improvement, which is the legitimate object of all
                  dramatic productions. </p>
               <p>This seems to have been the design of Moliere in his play of L’Avare, which,
                  having been translated into English, and frequently acted on our stage under the
                  title of the Miser, is well known to all who are fond of the drama. This character
                  is not intended to represent an ordinary miser, but to be the personification of
                  avarice itself; which, though one of the most detestable passions of the human
                  breast, furnishes, perhaps, more ridiculous varieties than any other; and while it
                  creates as much disgust as the understanding which contemplates it can feel, its
                  conduct is pregnant with circumstances equally calculated to produce mirth; at the
                  same time its distresses are generally of a nature which the most benevolent heart
                  cannot regard with commiseration. </p>
               <p>Hence it is that the moralists and philosophers of all ages, who have attacked
                  this irreclaimable vice, appear to have preferred the weapons of wit and humour,
                  in order to create the laugh against it; than those of serious argument and solemn
                  observation, to awaken grave sentiment and moral abhorrence. Thus we find
                  ourselves, as it were, habitually disposed to make avaricious characters the
                  objects rather of a laughing derision, than bitter reproach. Who, it may be asked,
                  can check sensations of merriment at the following stories of misers, though
                  represented to be in the most awful of all situations – the hour of death? </p>
               <p>An old usurer, stretched on his sick bed, and in his last agonies, was presented
                  by the priest with a rich crucifix as an object of worship and consolation. He
                  opens his eyes, considers the cross, and exclaims, ere he expires—"Those jewels
                  are all false, and I can only lend five pounds on such a pledge." </p>
               <p>Another well known miser, finding himself at his last hour, sent for some of the
                  directors of a neighbouring charity, and gave them a bill of a hundred pounds,
                  payable after his decease, which sum he ordered to be disposed of in the service
                  of their institution; but they had not left the room many minutes when he ordered
                  them to be called back, and offered them ready money if they would allow him the
                  discount. I do not answer for the authenticity of these stories, though our own
                  experience will, I should imagine, furnish us with similar instances of
                  persevering avarice. </p>
               <p>One of the best fables of La Motte is on this subject, and does not fail in giving
                  pleasantry to its moral.--"A miser being dead, and, which is of consequence on the
                  occasion, being interred, arrived at the banks of the Styx, and desired to be
                  ferried over with the other ghosts. Charon, however, insisted on his fare; and was
                  equally disappointed and surprised when he saw the miser, in order to avoid paying
                  it, throw himself into the river, and swim over to the other side, in spite of all
                  the clamour and opposition which the unexpected attempt occasioned. All hell was
                  in an uproar; and each of the judges meditated some punishment proportioned to a
                  crime of such dangerous consequence to the infernal revenues. Shall he be chained
                  to the rock with Prometheus? or tremble beneath the precipice in company with the
                  Danaides? or assist Sisyphus in rolling his stone? were the questions which issued
                  from the tribunal. 'No,' said Minos; 'none of these is sufficient, we must invent
                  some severer punishment. Let him be sent back to the earth, to see the use which
                  his heirs are making of his riches.'" </p>
               <p>Just as I had finished this lively apologue, I received the following letter,
                  which, though it is not an immediate branch of the subject before me, may be
                  considered as bearing such a relation to it, as to justify its present insertion.
                  Besides, I may, at any time, write an essay on Avarice; but it is not always in my
                  power to oblige a young lady of talents and beauty. That my fair correspondent
                  possesses the former, her letter sufficiently proves; and that she is adorned with
                  the latter, I am most willing to believe, as I have her own authority for it. </p>
               <p>Mr. SPECTATOR,</p>
               <p>It is now six months, sir, since I attained twenty-one years of age, and I have
                  reason to believe, from other information besides that of my looking-glass, that I
                  am very handsome. Nor am I without the accomplishments that proceed from a
                  fashionable education. But I am still unmarried, and, what is worse, without any
                  immediate prospect of quitting my uncheery condition. Nor can I attribute the
                  misfortune, for such I frankly consider it, to any other cause, but that
                  confounded thing called money. I am not, indeed, at present without what are
                  esteemed the comforts, as well as many of the pleasures of life; for I live with a
                  good-humoured, cheerful, kind-hearted dowager of an aunt, who enjoys a very
                  handsome jointure: but such is her hospitable and benevolent disposition, that she
                  lives up to the full extent of it, so that I have little to expect from her; and
                  whenever it shall please heaven to take her to itself, and the spasms with which
                  she is affected are, at times, very alarming, I shall be left with no more than
                  the paltry sum of fifteen hundred pounds. In that case, if a husband to my mind
                  does not come, in the mean time, to my preservation, I shall have no alternative,
                  but to retire into some cheap, distant part of the kingdom, to board in a
                  farm-house, or, perhaps, to marry a country parson; and like those flowers which
                  are born to blush unseen, I, too, may waste my sweetness on the desert air. </p>
               <p>It is not that I am destitute of admiration or attentions; I have, on the
                  contrary, no small portion of them such as they are, but they are very different
                  from those which are paid to the vulgar minxes, who have ten thousand pounds in
                  their pockets. I have overheard it said, What a fine girl that is! but what a pity
                  also it is that she has no fortune!--If Arabella Languish had ten thousand pounds,
                  says another, I would marry her to-morrow.--Faith! exclaims a third, I am
                  absolutely in love with that charming young woman; but I am not equal to living in
                  a cottage, though she were the mistress of it; or to be contented with roasted
                  apples and saw-dusty, though she dressed the dinner. Nay, it was but last week,
                  that a diminutive figure of an heiress, not four feet high, with a nose half as
                  long as herself, a pair of eyes that looked in all directions, the complexion of a
                  Portuguese, and a mouth wide enough to admit of her jumping down her own throat,
                  said to me in a very sarcastic tone--"You are, my dear, it must be confessed, a
                  tall, fine figure, but when I stand upon my father’s title-deeds, I completely
                  overlook you." I was fool enough to be piqued, and to tell her, that though in
                  that case she might look over me, all her father's title-deeds, ten times told,
                  would not purchase her the power to look like me; and thus our conversation and
                  acquaintance ended. </p>
               <p>Nor is this all. The son of an attorney who transacts business for my aunt,
                  thought proper to be continually repeating such warm declarations in my favour, as
                  to alarm his father, who forbade him to speak to me, and threatened to turn him
                  out of doors if he married me. I did not hesitate, however, to shew my resentment
                  to his insolence, and to take the first and most public opportunity to assure him,
                  that he might hush his alarms at my having any design on his cub of a sin, as,
                  whatever might be my matrimonial lot, I was determined, at least, to marry into an
                  honest family. </p>
               <p>Such are the mortifications I continually receive from the sordid spirit of the
                  world, which makes money the principle of all its views and actions, and is
                  contented that it shall stand in the stead of virtue, honour, talent, and even
                  beauty itself. </p>
               <p>I have not been, I must confess, without offers of marriage; but they add to my
                  humiliation. An officer in a marching regiment, quartered in a neighbouring town,
                  chose to become so deeply enamoured of me, as to write me a proposal of marriage
                  to the following effect.--After declaring the violence of his passion through four
                  sides and a half of foolscap paper, and assuring me that, if he were
                  commander-in-chief, he would lay his heart and all his power at my feet, he very
                  candidly informed me that all he possessed in the world was his pay, which
                  amounted to no more than ten shillings a day; at the same time, he added, that he
                  had the expectation of getting the ,majority of his regiment, and that my fortune
                  would enable him to purchase the lieutenant-coloneley: that they were, he must
                  own, ordered to Nova Scotia; at which place, however, when he had obtained the
                  expected rank, he should be a person of considerable consequence. He acknowledged,
                  indeed, that it was a cold, ungenial climate; but he had no doubt that we should
                  be able to soften all its rigours by the warmth of our mutual affection. </p>
               <p>Such an offer demanded, at least, a civil answer; so, after a compliment or two in
                  reply to his passionate effusions, I told him, that I absolutely shuddered at the
                  idea of a sea voyage, which the crown of the Indies would not tempt me to
                  undertake: and that, after all, if he should be called into active service, and
                  lose his life, as I could not doubt he was most heroically prepared to do in
                  fighting for Old England, I should then be left in that cold country without the
                  means of keeping myself warm, or finding any one, perhaps, who would be charitable
                  enough to do it for me. </p>
               <p>A portrait-painter, also, and indeed an artist of some merit, and as you, I doubt
                  not, will think of some impudence, who, during the summer, exerts his professional
                  talents in a provincial progress, and was employed to paint my aunt's picture,
                  felt himself encouraged, by the abominable state of my finances, to venture on
                  making a matrimonial proposition to me. He said, it had long been his
                  determination never to marry any woman who would not serve him as a model to paint
                  after; and that I possessed the beauty of countenance, the perfection of for, and
                  the graces of attitude, which precisely placed me in that predicament. It would
                  have been a folly to abuse the silly fellow; and, therefore, I replied, with
                  apparent good humour, that as these qualities of mine were at best no made to
                  last, and as accidents of various kinds might shorten their natural duration, I
                  might, perchance, very shortly lose that usefulness on which he appeared to found
                  a regard, which would vanish with it. Such a state of trembling apprehension, I
                  begged leave to decline; and as his affection seemed to be so very mechanical, I
                  recommended him to direct his attachment to a lay-figure, which would remain the
                  same to the end of his life. </p>
               <p>The men of fortune it is true say very handsome things to me, but in a way that
                  does not not at all savour of matrimonial inclinations; nay, were it not for the
                  very respectable protection of my aunt, I am persuaded that I should have
                  proposals from some of them in which Hymen would have no concern. Indeed, I cannot
                  even fancy a probability that the wind will, from any quarter, blow me such a
                  husband as I would accept; through, if the man were a gentleman, I should not be
                  very difficult. In short, I have no prospect of any addition to my miserable
                  pittance of a fortune; and, without it, I appear to be destined to that most
                  cheerless and disgraceful of all conditions, exclusive of vice and crime, -- a
                  compulsory state of celibacy. </p>
               <p>In this situation, I have employed my very active mind in forming a plan for
                  augmenting the number of marriages; and I am confident, that the interest which
                  such a benevolent spirit as yours must take in the lot of those youthful vestals,
                  who feel a flame in their hearts, which nature tells them it is their duty to keep
                  alive, will induce you to assist me in publishing my project; and as the state,
                  from the essential benefits resulting from it, will, I should think, carry it into
                  immediate execution, I can have little doubt, that public justice will bestow such
                  a reward on the inventress, as will soon procure her a husband, who in rank,
                  manners, fortune, and figure, will satisfy her ambition, her understanding, and
                  her affection. I shall state my plan in as brief a way as the right understanding
                  of it will admit. </p>
               <p>As marriage is, and has long been very generally denominated, a lottery, I propose
                  to give my scheme the name, as it, indeed, adopts the character of that mode of
                  distributing the gifts of Fortune. I shall call it, therefore, the Lottery of
                  Hymen. </p>
               <p>In the first place, I propose that the kingdom shall be divided into a certain
                  number of districts of a moderate size, of which a city, or some principal town,
                  may form the center; and wherein the inhabitants must be arranged and classified
                  according to their respective ranks, fortunes and occupations. </p>
               <p>2. On the first day of every month, all the unmarried men in each district, who
                  have not passed their thirtieth year, shall be obliged, under a heavy penalty, to
                  give in their names and stations to a person specially appointed to the office of
                  receiving them; while every father of a family shall be equally compellable, under
                  a similar penalty, to deliver the names of his unmarried daughters, who have
                  attained the age of eighteen, to the same officer. </p>
               <p>3. That on the fifteenth day of each month, if it does not fall on a Sunday, and
                  then on the sixteenth, the persons of the first class, whose names have been thus
                  received, shall appear at a stated hour in a place suited to the purpose, and the
                  different sexes be properly ranged at a becoming distance from each other; the
                  females being covered with veils, that their faces may not be distinguished: while
                  no one shall be admitted but the parties immediately interested in the object of
                  the assembly, and the official attendants. </p>
               <p>4. That the wheel in which the names of the young men only shall be deposited,
                  being turned round with due formality, one of the names shall be drawn from it;
                  when he whose name is exposed shall be publicly declared as destined to become the
                  votary of Hymen, and be immediately and solemnly commanded by the president, who
                  must be the father of the largest family in the district, to make his choice of
                  one of the females before him. </p>
               <p>5. On the young man's presenting himself for that purpose, the females who feel a
                  disposition to be chosen by him, must immediately lift up their veils, when he
                  will select his future bride; while they who do not wish to be preferred by him,
                  are at liberty to remain covered, and wait a future opportunity, when the name of
                  some one more suited to their preference may be drawn: a stipulated fine, however,
                  must be paid for the exercise of this privilege. </p>
               <p>The other classes then follow in rotation, with the same formalities. Thus a
                  certain, and no inconsiderable, number of marriages with necessarily take place
                  every month, in every part of the kingdom; and, I cannot help thinking, with as
                  great probability of domestic comfort, as in those matches which are made by papas
                  and mammas, without consulting the real happiness of their children; or by
                  children without consulting the pleasure of their papas and mammas; or even such
                  as are brought about in Idalian groves, and where the hymeneal coach is rendered
                  fragrant by roses, showered down by bands of fluttering Cupids. </p>
               <p>6. That the penalties and fines paid on these occasions, which, from the fancies
                  and caprices of young people of certain ages, must prove very considerable, shall
                  form a fund to supply comfortable fortunes, according to their stations, for those
                  who have attended these assemblies during a certain settled period, without having
                  been chosen by any one. </p>
               <p>I give this merely as a general idea, to be rectified, modified, enlarged, and
                  finally arranged by those whose experience and knowledge of the world qualify them
                  for the office. For this purpose, I should recommend a board to be appointed,
                  under the all-powerful sanction of an act of parliament, to consist of an equal
                  number of married men and bachelors, with a widower, who has buried two wives at
                  least, as chairman. </p>
               <p>One proposition more and I have done.--That the members of the aforesaid board may
                  not be paid salaries for carrying the project into execution, as they will then
                  most assuredly prolong the final settlement of it for several years; but that
                  government should engage to give each of them a handsome specific sum, when all
                  the necessary arrangements are concluded; and then the business will be done in a
                  few weeks. </p>
               <p>It will not be long, I trust, after such a result takes place, that I shall have
                  to thank you for assisting me in this great and good work, under another name than
                  that of </p>
