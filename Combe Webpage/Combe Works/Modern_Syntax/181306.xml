    <p>So numerous are my correspondents, that if I had not determined to take them according to the
        date of their arrival, I should be in a state of continual perplexity. Nay, as it is, if
            <persName>Mr. Ackermann</persName> was to publish his admirable miscellany every week,
        instead of every month, it would be regularly supplied with such productions as mine.</p>
    <p>As a man of humanity, and impressed with the love of my fellow-creatures, which I profess
        myself to be, I cannot but feel a very sensible mortification, that so many persons address
        thenselves [sic] to me in the language of complaint, and, as far as I can judge, without any
        just cause of lamentation: I mean, as rational, reflecting, consistent beings, who must know
        that life is a chequered state; that trouble is a part of our allotment; that the day of our
        existence is shaded with clouds as it is brightened with sunshine, and that to bear with
        fortitude and resignation the pains and sorrows to which we are subject, is a duty that
        religion enjoins, and which the just Being who, for wise purposes, inflicted them upon us,
        will finally reward. But the complaints which reach me, are many of them so trivial, that
        they rather dispose me to laughter than commiseration</p>
    <p>A gentleman writes me word, that he has a very susceptible heart; that he is continually
        under the influence of the tender passion, and wishes, above all things, to unite himself in
        the hymeneal bonds with some lady whose charms, accomplishments, and disposition, may
        combine to render his life happy. He knows, according to his own account, several charming
        young women who answer this description, and who would probably yield to his solicitations,
        if he had it in his power clearly to express them; but, from some bad habit contracted when
        a child, or perhaps an original defect in the organs of speech, he cannot tell a lady that
        he <emph rend="italic">loves</emph> her, or that she is lovely. In short, he cannot, without extreme
        difficulty, agitation, and grimace, pronounce any word that begins with, or comprehends the
        letter L. Thus, he is so long in saying to any attractive fair on, I l-o-o-o-o-o-ve you, and
        accompanies the declaration with such sputtering and distortion of features, that the lady
        is ready to die with confusion or with laughter, before he has concluded his declaration:
        nay, sometimes he has himself been so overcome, as not, after all, to give the word
        utterance, without a sudden projecting motion of the head at the close, that threatens
        violence to the person he addresses, and which actually did, on one occasion, produce a
        bloody nose in a very pretty face, the owner of which has ever since denominated him,
            <emph rend="italic">Raw Head and Bloody Bones</emph>.</p>
    <p>It is certainly a most unfortunate defect in a man who is always in love, not to be able to
        pronounce the name of the passion which seems to be the main-spring of his actions, and on
        the gratification of which his happiness depends. There appear to be only two ways left for
        him, by which he can proceed: the one, by writing; and the other, by dumb show or pantomime;
        and it appears that he has tried them both without success. The first letter he wrote on
        this important subject, was worked up in all the strength of expression which the violence
        of his passion might urge him to employ. But the lady refused to listen to a declaration of
        love, which the gentleman who made it could not utter. She also added, that, with his
        infirmity, the lady who married him would be under the painful necessity of having all the
        talk to herself; a circumstance which the whole sex are known to abominate. His next trial
        was in verse; and he flattered himself, that poetry might be more favourable to him than
        prose. But here again he was unfortunate; for the fair one to whom he addressed himself,
        insisted upon it, that neither the Muses nor Cupid could consider him as their votary, or
        they would have contrived to untie his tongue for him. As for his dumb show, he is still
        more unsuccessful in that than in his attempts which have been just described. He had taken
        lessons, it seems, of some actor of consideration, who had taught him to employ every look
        and posture declaratory of the tender passion. He had been taught to sigh, to put on the
        mist piteous looks, to place his hands on his bosom, to kneel, and display and very posture
        of entreaty. But the first time he put this design in execution, the lady thought he had
        suddenly lost his senses, and expressed her alarms by such screams and shrieks, as called
        the whole family to her assistance. What is to be done for this poor gentleman, I am really
        at a loss to conceive. He has but a choice of evils; and nothing is left for him, but to
        find out some pleasing, agreeable woman, who is as deaf as a post; or an interesting young
        person, who has the same impediment as himself. In the former case, he may convey his ideas
        with his fingers, which will not stammer; and, in the latter, the happy couple will at least
        have a mutual sympathy; and if they cannot amuse each other by their conversation, they will
        be sure to be infinitely entertaining to every company which they may frequent.</p>
    <p>I am sorry to find, that I have at least a score of complaints from wives, of their husbands;
        and but one solitary declaration of discontent of a husband, respecting the conduct of his
        wife. One lady is extremely angry with her hymeneal companion, as she calls him, for being
        always from home, and leaving her to the dullness of her own melancholy society. While
        another is equally dissatisfied, that the master of her house, as she chuses to express
        herself, is never out of it, but in attendance upon her. She thought the other day, that she
        had contrived an agreeable absence, by a visit, for a short time, in an aguish situation in
        the country, where she was certain, as he is very careful of his health, that he would not
        accompany her. But he took a post-chaise secretly, and went another way, in order to afford
        her an agreeable surprise; so that, when she arrived at her journey’s end, she found,
            <emph rend="italic">pour comble de bonheur, son cher mari</emph> ready to receive her. She
        positively declares, that, if he continues to worry her in this manner she will do something
        or other to procure a divorce, and get rid of him for ever.</p>
    <p>There is no end to the accounts I have of domestic discontents, from the grandfather to the
        hundredth cousin; and in many of them there may be some cause of complaint. I only wish that
        I could discern, here and there, some well regulated mode of conduct and management, under
        these inconveniences, from which our condition is inseparable. But it really moves me from
        all moderation of temper, when I receive lamentations that could only be justified by the
        most aggravated calamities, on subjects not only trivial and ridiculous, but absolutely
        disgraceful.</p>
    <p><persName>Miss Flirtilla Simper</persName> complains of the cruelty of her mamma, for
        ordering her new dress to be jonquil and lilac, when she knew that her heart was set upon
        maiden’s blush.</p>
    <p>A lady, who has lately lost the best husband that ever woman possessed, and who, since his
        death, has never been able to get a moment’s sleep for thinking on him, till three or four
        o’clock in the morning, complains, in the bitterest terms, of a
        <emph rend="italic">devilish</emph>blackbird, belonging to some one in the neighbourhood, which
        about that hour begins his <emph rend="italic">infernal schritching</emph>, to the destruction of
        the only insensibility in which she can lose her griefs. Another complains of her being the
        peculiar object of ill-fortune. It seems, she says, as if every barbed arrow in the quiver
        of fate were to be discharged at her. She had lost three children and their fond father in
        the course of seven years. Scarce had she dried up her tears for the death of one, than they
        were called to flow another; and now, when her spirit had been brought into a placid state
        resignation, a new wound had been suddenly opened by the death of her two little darling
        parroquets, who died in the course of one night, and have left her perfectly disconsolate.
        There is a florist too, who complains, that, during the last two seasons, the weather has
        been altogether unfavourable to his shew of carnations, and that the sun, which shines upon
        all, exercises a malignant influence upon him.</p>
    <p>I shall conclude my catalogue of complainers with the enraged disappointments of a virtuoso,
        who, by accidentally slipping on a piece of orange-peel in the street, fell into the kennel;
        and, in consequence of being obliged to go into a coffee-house, to get himself cleaned and
        rubbed down, he came too late to a sale, and lost the purchase of a shell, which he had been
        hunting after for several years.</p>
    <p>It would be endless to enumerate the many fantastical afflictions that disturb mankind; but
        as a misery is not to be measured from the nature of the evil, but from the temper of the
        sufferer, I shall present my readers, who are unhappy in imagination, with the following
        allegory, for their instruction and amusement.</p>
    <p>When Jupiter took into his hands the government of the world, the several parts of nature,
        with the presiding deities, did homage to him. One presented him with a mountain of winds,
        another with a magazine of hail, and a third with a pile of thunderbolts. The stars offered
        up their influences, the ocean gave in his trident, the earth her fruits, and the sun his
        seasons. Among the several deities who came to make their court on the occasion, the
        Destinies advanced, with two great tuns carried before them, one of which they placed on the
        right hand of Jove’s throne, and the other on its left. The first was filled with all the
        blessings, the other with all the calamities of human life. Jupiter in the beginning of his
        reign, finding the world much more innocent than it is in this iron age, poured very
        plentifully out of the tun on his right hand; but as mankind degenerated, and became
        unworthy of his blessings, he set abroach the other vessel, that filled them with pain and
        poverty, battles and distempers, jealousy and false hood, intoxicating pleasures and
        untimely deaths.</p>
    <p>He was, at length, so greatly incensed at the increasing depravations of human nature, and
        the repeated provocations he received from all parts of the earth, that he commanded the
        Destinies to gather up the blessings which he had thrown away upon mankind, and lay them up
        until the world should be inhabited by a more virtuous and deserving race of mortals. The
        three sisters immediately repaired to the earth, in search of the several blessings that
        have been scattered on it; but found the task enjoined on them much more difficult than they
        had imagined. The first places to which they resorted, were, cities, palaces, and courts;
        but instead of meeting what they looked for here, they found nothing but envy, repining,
        uneasiness, and the bitter ingredients of the vessel on the left hand; while they found the
        substantial blessings of life in situations of tranquility and retirement. They observed,
        also, that several blessings had degenerated into calamities; and various calamities had
        improved into blessings, according as they fell into the possession of wise or foolish men.
        They often found power with so much insolence and impatience cleaving to it, that it became
        a misfortune to the person on whom it was conferred. Youth had often distempers growing
        about it, worse than the infirmities of old age; wealth was often united to such a sordid
        avarice, as made it the most uncomfortable and painful kind of poverty; and industry itself,
        by directing its efforts in wrong channels, had no better gains than those of idleness. On
        the contrary, they often found pain made glorious by fortitude, poverty lost in content, and
        deformity beautified with virtue. In short, the blessings were often, like good fruits,
        planted in a bad soil, that, by degrees, fall off from their natural flavor into tastes
        altogether insipid; and the calamities, like harsh fruits cultivated in a good soil, until
        they acquire delicious juices.</p>
    <p>There was still a third circumstance, that occasioned as great a surprise to the three
        sisters, as either of the foregoing; when they discovered several blessings and calamities
        which had never been in either of the tuns that stood by the side of Jupiter; and were,
        nevertheless, as great occasions of happiness or misery as any there. These were, that
        spurious crop of blessings and calamities which were never sown by the hand of the deity,
        but grow of themselves, out of the fancies and dispositions of human creatures: such are,
        dress, titles, place. Equipage, groundless fear, and all the vain imaginations that shoot up
        in trifling, weak, and irresolute minds.</p>
    <p>At length, the Destinies, finding themselves in so perplexed a state, concluded, that it
        would be impossible for them to execute the commands which had been given them, according to
        their first intention; for which reason, they agreed to throw all the blessings and
        calamities together into one large vessel, and in that manner offer them up at the feet of
        Jupiter. This was performed accordingly; when the elder of the sisters addressed the deity
        in the following manner:</p>
    <p>”O Jupiter, we have gathered together all the good and evil, the comforts and distresses of
        human life; which we thus present before thee, in one promiscuous heap. We beseech thee,
        that thou thyself will sort them out for the future, as in thy wisdom thou shalt think fit;
        for we acknowledge, that there is no power besides thine, that can judge what will occasion
        grief or joy in the heart of a human creature, and what will prove a blessing or a calamity
        to the person on whom it is bestowed.”</p>
    <p>A stanza from <persName>Spenser</persName>, shall conclude my subject:</p>
    <l>In vaine, thou, said old <persName>Melibee</persName>, doe men</l>
    <l>The heavens of their fortune’s fault accuse;</l>
    <l>Sith they know best, what is the best for them</l>
    <l>For, they to each such fortune doe diffuse,</l>
    <l>As they do knowe each can most aptly use.</l>
    <l>For, not that, which men covet most, is best</l>
    <l>Nor that thing worst, which men doe most refuse;</l>
    <l>But fittest is, that all contented rest</l>
    <l>With what they hold – each has his fortune in his breast.</l>
