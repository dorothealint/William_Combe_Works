<lg>
<l>The school was done,</l>
<l>the bus'ness o'er,</l>
<l>When, tir'd of Greek</l>
<l>and Latin lore,</l>
<l>Good SYNTAX sought</l>
<l>his easy chair,</l>
<l>And sat in calm composure there.</l>
<l>His wife was to a neighbour gone,</l>
<l>To hear the chit-chat of the town;</l>
<l>And left him the unfrequent power</l>
<l>Of brooding through a quiet hour.</l>
<l>Thus, while he sat, a busy train</l>
<l>Of images besieged his brain.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Of church-preferment he had none;</l>
<l>Nay, all his hope of that was gone:</l>
<l>He felt that he content must be</l>
<l>With drudging in a curacy.</l>
<l>Indeed, on ev'ry Sabbath-day,</l>
<l>Through eight long miles he took his way,</l>
<l>To preach, to grumble, and to pray;</l>
<l>To cheer the good, to warn the sinner,</l>
<l>And, if he got it,--eat a dinner:</l>
<l>To bury these, to christen those,</l>
<l>And marry such fond folks as chose</l>
<l>To change the tenor of their life,</l>
<l>And risk the matrimonial strife.</l>
<l>Thus were his weekly journies made,
'Neath summer suns and wintry shade;</l>
<l>And all his gains, it did appear,</l>
<l>Were only thirty pounds a-year.</l>
<l>Besides, th'augmenting taxes press,</l>
<l>To aid expense and add distress:</l>
<l>Mutton and beef, and bread and beer,</l>
<l>And ev'ry thing was grown so dear;</l>
<l>The boys, too, always prone to eat,</l>
<l>Delighted less in books than meat;</l>
<l>So that, when holy Christmas came,</l>
<l>His earnings ceas'd to be the same,</l>
<l>And now, alas! could do no more,</l>
<l>Than keep the wolf without the door.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>E'en birch, the pedant master's boast,</l>
<l>Was so increas'd in worth and cost,</l>
<l>That oft, prudentially beguil'd,</l>
<l>To save the rod, he spar'd the child.</l>
<l>Thus, if the times refus'd to mend,</l>
<l>He to his school must put an end.</l>
<l>How hard his lot! how blind his fate!</l>
<l>What shall he do to mend his state?</l>
<l>Thus did poor Syntax ruminate;</l>
<l>When, as the vivid meteros fly,</l>
<l>And instant light the gloomy sky,</l>
<l>A sudden thought across him came,</l>
<l>And told the way to wealth and fame;</l>
<l>And, as th' expanding vision grew</l>
<l>Wider and wider to his view,</l>
<l>The painted fancy did beguile</l>
<l>His woe-worn phiz into a smile:</l>
<l>But, while he pac'd the room around,</l>
<l>Or stood immers'd in thought profound,</l>
<l>THe Doctor, 'midst his rumination,</l>
<l>Was waken'd by a visitation</l>
<l>Which troubles many a poor man's life-</l>
<l>The visitation of his wife.</l>
<l>Good Mrs. Syntax was a lady,</l>
<l>Ten years, perhaps, beyond her hey-day;</l>
<l>But though the blooming charms had flown,</l>
<l>That grac'd her youth, it still was known</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The love of power she had never lost,</l>
<l>As Syntax found it to his cost;</l>
<l>For as her words were used to flow,</l>
<l>He but replied or YES or NO.</l>
<l>Whene'er enrag'd by some disaster,</l>
<l>She'd shake the boys and cuff the master;</l>
<l>Nay, to avenge the slightest wrong,</l>
<l>She could employ both arms and tongue;</l>
<l>And, if we list to country tales,</l>
<l>She sometimes would enforce her nails.</l>
<l>Her face was red, her form was fat,</l>
<l>A round-about, and rather squat;</l>
<l>And when in angry humour stalking,</l>
<l>Was like a dumpling set a-walking.
'Twas not the custom of this spouse</l>
<l>To suffer long a quiet house:</l>
<l>She was among those busy wives,</l>
<l>Who hurry-scurry through their lives;</l>
<l>And make amends for fading beauty</l>
<l>By telling husbands of their duty.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>'Twas at this moment, when, inspir'd,</l>
<l>And by his new ambition fir'd,</l>
<l>The pious man his hands uprear'd,</l>
<l>The pious man his hands uprear'd,</l>
<l>The Mrs. Syntax re-appear'd:</l>
<l>Amaz'd she look'd, and loud she shriek'd,</l>
<l>Or, rather like a pig she squeak'd,</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>To see her humble husband dare</l>
<l>Thus quit his sober ev'ning chair,</l>
<l>And pace, with varying steps, about,</l>
<l>Now in the room, and now without.</l>
<l>At first, she did not find her tongue,
(A thing which seldom happen'd long,)</l>
<l>But soon that organ grew unquiet,</l>
<l>To ask the cause of all this riot.</l>
<l>The Doctor smil'd, and thus address'd</l>
<l>The secrets of his lab'ring breast-</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Sit down, my love, my dearest dear,</l>
<l>Nay, prithee, do, and patient hear;</l>
<l>Let me, for once, throughout my life,</l>
<l>Receive this kindness from my wife;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>It will oblige me so:-in troth,</l>
<l>It will, my dear, oblige us both;</l>
<l>For such a plan has come athwart me,</l>
<l>Which some kind sprite from Heav'n has brought me</l>
<l>That if you will your counsels join,</l>
<l>To aid this golden scheme of mine,</l>
<l>New days will come-new times appear,</l>
<l>And teeming plenty crown the year:</l>
<l>We then on dainty bits shall dine,</l>
<l>And change our home-brew'd ale for wine:</l>
<l>On summer days, to take the air,</l>
<l>We'll put our Grizzle to a chair;</l>
<l>While you, in silks and muslins fine,</l>
<l>The grocer's wife shall far outshine,</l>
<l>And neighb'ring folks be forc'd to own,</l>
<l>In this fair town you give the ton."
"Oh! tell me," cried the smiling dame,
"Tell me this golden road to fame:</l>
<l>You charm my heart, you quite delight it."-
"<emph rend="italic">I'll make a </emph>TOUR-<emph rend="italic">and then I'll</emph> WRITE IT.</l>
<l>You well know what my pen can do,</l>
<l>And I'll employ my pencil too:-</l>
<l>I'll ride and <emph rend="italic">write</emph>, and <emph rend="italic">sketch</emph> and <emph rend="italic">print</emph>,</l>
<l>And thus create a real mint;</l>
<l>I'll <emph rend="italic">prose</emph> it here, I'll <emph rend="italic">verse</emph> it there,</l>
<l>And <emph rend="italic">picturesque</emph> it ev'ry where:</l>
<l>I'll do what all have done before;</l>
<l>I think I shall-and somewhat more;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>At Doctor <emph rend="italic">Pompous</emph> give a look;</l>
<l>He made his fortune by a book;</l>
<l>And if my volume does not beat it,</l>
<l>When I return I'll fry and eat it.</l>
<l>Next week the boys will all go home,</l>
<l>And I shall have a mouth to come.</l>
<l>My clothes, my cash, my all prepare;</l>
<l>While <emph rend="italic">Ralph</emph> looks to the grizzle mare.</l>
<l>Tho' wond'ring folks may laugh and scoff,</l>
<l>By this day fortnight I'll be off;</l>
<l>And when old Time a month has run,</l>
<l>Our bus'ness, <emph rend="italic">Lovey</emph>, will be done.</l>
<l>I will in search of fortune roam,</l>
<l>While you enjoy yourself at home."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The story told, the Doctor eas'd</l>
<l>Of his grand plan, and Madam pleas'd,</l>
<l>No pains were spar'd by night or day</l>
<l>To set him forward on his way:</l>
<l>She trimm'd his coat-she mended all</l>
<l>His various clothing, great and small;</l>
<l>And better still, a purse was found</l>
<l>With twenty notes, of each a pound.</l>
<l>Thus furnish'd, and in full condition</l>
<l>To prosper in his expedition;</l>
<l>At length the ling'ring moment came,</l>
<l>That gave the dawn of wealth and fame.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Incurious <emph rend="italic">Ralph, exact at four,</emph></l>
<l>Led Grizzle, saddled, to the door;</l>
<l>And soon, with more than common state,</l>
<l>The Doctor stood before the gate.</l>
<l>Behind him was his faithful wife;-
"One more embrace my dearest life!"</l>
<l>Then his grey palfrey he bestrode,</l>
<l>And gave a nod, and off he rode.
"Good luck! good luck!" she loudly cried;
"<emph rend="italic">Vale! O Vale!</emph>" he replied.</l>
</lg></div>
        
<div type="canto" n="2"><head>Canto II.</head>
    
<lg>
<l>The farewell cere-</l>
<l>mony o'er,</l>
<l>Madam went in and</l>
<l>bang'd the door:</l>
<l>No woful tear</l>
<l>bedew'd her eye,</l>
<l>Nor did she heave a single sigh;</l>
<l>But soon began her daily trade,</l>
<l>To chide the man and scold the maid;</l>
<l>While Syntax, with his scheme besotted,</l>
<l>Along the village gently trotted.</l>
<l>The folks on daily labour bent,</l>
<l>Whistled and caroll'd as they went;</l>
<l>But as the Doctor pass'd along,</l>
<l>Bow'd down their heads, and ceas'd their song.</l>
<l>He gravely nodded to the people;</l>
<l>Then looking upwards to the steeple,</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>He thus, in mutt'ring tones, express'd</l>
<l>The disappointments of his breast.</l>
<l>"That thankless parent, Mother Church,</l>
<l>Has ever left me in the lurch;</l>
<l>And, while so many fools are seen</l>
<l>To strut a Rector or a Dean,</l>
<l>Who live in ease, and find good cheer</l>
<l>On ev'ry day of ev'ry year,</l>
<l>So small her share of true discerning,</l>
<l>She turn'd her back on all my learning.</l>
<l>I've in her vineyard labour'd hard,</l>
<l>And what has been my lean reward?</l>
<l>I've dug the ground, while some rich Vicar</l>
<l>Press'd the ripe grape, and drank the liquor;</l>
<l>I feed the flock, while others eat</l>
<l>The mutton's nice, delicious meat;</l>
<l>I've kept the hive, and made the honey,</l>
<l>While the drones pocketed the money.</l>
<l>But now, on better things intent,</l>
<l>On far more grateful labours bent,</l>
<l>New prospects open to my view;</l>
<l>So, thankless Mother Church, adieu!"</l>
<l>Thus, having said his angry say,</l>
<l>Syntax proceeded on his way.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The morning lark ascends on high,</l>
<l>And with its music greets the sky:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The blackbird whistles, and the thrush</l>
<l>Warbles his wild notes in the bush;</l>
<l>While ev'ry hedeg and ev'ry tree</l>
<l>Resound with vocal minstrelsy.</l>
<l>But Syntax, wrapt in thought profound,</l>
<l>Is deaf to each enliv'ning sound:</l>
<l>Revolving many a golden scheme,</l>
<l>And yielding to the pleasing dream,</l>
<l>The reins hung loosely from his hand;</l>
<l>While Grizzle, senseless of command,</l>
<l>Unguided, pac'd the road along,</l>
<l>Nor knew if it were right or wrong.</l>
<l>Through the deep vale, and up the hill,</l>
<l>By rapid stream or tinkling rill,</l>
<l>Grizzle her thoughtful master bore,</l>
<l>Who, counting future treasure o'er,</l>
<l>And, on his weighty projects bent,</l>
<l>Observ'd not whither Grizzle went.</l>
<l>Thus did kind Fancy's soothing power</l>
<l>Cheat him of many a fleeting hour;</l>
<l>Nor did he know the pacing Sun</l>
<l>Had half his daily circuit run.</l>
<l>Sweet, airy sprite, that can bestow</l>
<l>A pleasing respite to our woe;</l>
<l>That can corroding care beguile,</l>
<l>And make the woe-worn face to smile!</l>
<l>But, ah! too soon the vision passes,</l>
<l>Confounded by a pack of asses!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The donkeys bray'd; and lo! the sound</l>
<l>Awak'd him from his thought profound;</l>
<l>And as he star'd, and look'd around,</l>
<l>He said-orelse he seem'd to say-
"I find that I have lost my way.</l>
<l>Oh! what a wide expanse I see,</l>
<l>Without a wood, without a tree!</l>
<l>No one at hand, no house is near,</l>
<l>To tell the way, or give good cheer;</l>
<l>For now a sign would be a treat,</l>
<l>To tell us we might drink and eat;</l>
<l>But sure there is not in my sight</l>
<l>The sign of any living wight;</l>
<l>And all around upon this common</l>
<l>I see not either man or woman;</l>
<l>Nor dogs to bark, nor cocks to crow,</l>
<l>Nor sheep to bleat, nor herds to low</l>
<l>Nay, if these asses did not bray,</l>
<l>And thus some signs of life betray,</l>
<l>I well might think that I were hurl'd</l>
<l>Into some sad, unpeopled world.</l>
<l>How could I come, misguided wretch!</l>
<l>To where I cannot make a sketch?"</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus as he ponder'd what to do,</l>
<l>A guide-post rose within his view;</l>
<l>And, when the pleasing shape he spied,</l>
<l>He prick'd his steed, and thither hied;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But some unheeding, senseless wight,</l>
<l>Who to fair learning owed a spite,</l>
<l>Had ev'ry letter'd mark defac'd,</l>
<l>Which once its several pointers grac'd.</l>
<l>The mangled post this long had stood,</l>
<l>An uninforming piece of wood;</l>
<l>Like other guides, as some folks say,</l>
<l>Who neither lead, not tell the way.</l>
<l>The Sun, as hot as he was bright,</l>
<l>Had got to his meridian height;</l>
<l>'Twas sultry noon-for not a breath</l>
<l>Of cooling zephyr fann'd the heath;</l>
<l>When Syntax cried-"'Tis all in vain</l>
<l>To find my way across the plain;</l>
<l>So here my fortune I will try,</l>
<l>And wait till some one passes by:</l>
<l>Upon that bank awhile I'll sit,</l>
<l>And let poor Grizzle graze a bit;</l>
<l>But, as my time shall not be lost,</l>
<l>I'll make a drawing of the post;</l>
<l>And, tho' a flimsy taste may flout it,</l>
<l>There's something <emph rend="italic">pictureseque</emph> about it:</l>
<l>'Tis rude and rough, without a gloss,</l>
<l>And is well covered o'er with moss;</l>
<l>And I've a right-(who dares deny it?)</l>
<l>To place yon group of asses by it.</l>
<l>Ay! this will do: and now I'm thinking,</l>
<l>That self-same pond where Grizzle's drinking,</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>If hither brought 'twould better seem,</l>
<l>And, faith, I'll turn it to a stream:</l>
<l>I'll make this flat a shaggy ridge,</l>
<l>And o'er the water throw a bridge:</l>
<l>I'll do as other sketchers do-</l>
<l>Put anything into the view;</l>
<l>And any object recollect,</l>
<l>To add a grace, and give effect.</l>
<l>Thus, though from truth I haply err,</l>
<l><emph rend="italic">The scene preserves its character.</emph></l>
<l>What man of taste my right will doubt,</l>
<l>To put things in, or leave them out?</l>
<l>'Tis more than right, it is a duty,</l>
<l>If we consider landscape beauty:</l>
<l>He ne'er will as an artist shine,</l>
<l>Who copies Nature line by line:</l>
<l>Whoe'er from Nature takes a view,</l>
<l>Must copy and improve her too.</l>
<l>To heighten every work of art,</l>
<l>Fancy should take an active part:</l>
<l>Thus I (which few I think can boast)</l>
<l><emph rend="italic">Have made a Landscape of a Post.</emph></l>
<l>"So far, so good-but no one passes,</l>
<l>No living creature but these asses;</l>
<l>And, should I sit and hear them bray,</l>
<l>I were as great a beast as they:</l>
<l>So I'll be off; from yonder down</l>
<l>I may, perhaps, descry a town;</l>
<l>Or some tall spire among the trees</l>
<l>May give my way-worn spirits ease."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Grizzle again he soon bestrode,</l>
<l>And wav'd his whip, and off he rode:</l>
<l>But all around was dingy green,</l>
<l>No spire arose, no town was seen.</l>
<l>At length he reach'd a beaten road;</l>
<l>How great a joy the sight bestow'd!</l>
<l>So on he went, in pleasant mood,</l>
<l>And shortly gain'd a stately wood,</l>
<l>Where the refreshing zephyrs play'd,</l>
<l>And cool'd the air beneath the shade.</l>
<l>Oh! what a change, how gerat the treat,</l>
<l>To fanning breeze from sultry heat!</l>
<l>But, ah! how false is human joy!</l>
<l>When least we think it, ills annoy:</l>
<l>For now, with fierce impetuous rush,</l>
<l>Three ruffians issued from a bush;</l>
<l>One Grizzle stopp'd, and seiz'd the reins,</l>
<l>While they all threat the Doctor's brains.</l>
<l>Poor Syntax, trembling with affright,</l>
<l>Resists not such superior might,</l>
<l>But yields him to their savage pleasure,</l>
<l>And gives his purse, with all its treasure.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Fearing, howe'er, the Doctor's view</l>
<l>Might be to follow and pursue;</l>
<l>The cunning robbers wisely counted</l>
<l>That he, of course, should be dismounted;</l>
<l>And still that it would safer be,</l>
<l>If he were fasten'd to a tree.</l>
<l>Thus to a tree they quickly bound him;</l>
<l>The cruel cords went round and round him;</l>
<l>And, having of all power bereft him,</l>
<l>They tied him fast-and then they left him.</l>
</lg></div>
        
<div type="canto" n="3"><head>Canto III.</head>
    
<lg>
<l>By the road side,</l>
<l>within the wood,</l>
<l>In this sad state</l>
<l>poor Syntax stood;</l>
<l>His bosom heav'd</l>
<l>with many a sigh,</l>
<l>And the tears stood in either eye.</l>
<l>What could he do?-he durst not bawl;</l>
<l>His noise the robbers might recall;</l>
<l>The villains might again surround him,</l>
<l>And hang him up where they had bound him.</l>
<l>Sure never was an hapless wight</l>
<l>In more uncomfortable plight:</l>
<l>Nor was this all; his pate was bare,</l>
<l>Unshelter'd by one lock of hair;</l>
<l>For when the sturdy robbers took him,</l>
<l>His hat and peruke both forsook him.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The insect world were on the wing,</l>
<l>Whose talent is to buz and sting;</l>
<l>And soon his bare-worn head they sought,</l>
<l>By instinct led, by nature taught;</l>
<l>And dug their little forks within</l>
<l>The tender texture of his skin.</l>
<l>He raged and roar'd, but all in vain,</l>
<l>No means he found to ease his pain:</l>
<l>The cords, which to the tree had tied him,</l>
<l>All help from either hand denied him:</l>
<l>He shook his head, he writh'd his face</l>
<l>With painful look, with sad grimace,</l>
<l>And thus he spoke his hapless case!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Ah! miserable man," he cried,</l>
<l>"What perils do my course betide!</l>
<l>In this sad melancholy state,</l>
<l>Must I, alas! impatient wait,</l>
<l>Till some kind soul shall haply find me,</l>
<l>And with his friendly hands unbind me?</l>
<l>Nay, I throughout the night may stay,</l>
<l>'Tis such an unfrequented way:</l>
<l>Tho' what with hunger, thirst and fright,</l>
<l>I ne'er shall last throughout the night;</l>
<l>And could I e'en these ills survive,</l>
<l>The flies will eat me up alive.</l>
<l>What mad ambition made me roam?</l>
<l>Ah! wherefore did I quit my home?</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>For there I liv'd, remote from harm;</l>
<l>My meals were good, my house was warm;</l>
<l>And, though I was not free from strife,</l>
<l>With other ills that troubled life</l>
<l>Yet I had learn'd full well to bear</l>
<l>The nightly scold, the daily care;</l>
<l>And, after many a season past,</l>
<l>I should have found repose at last:</l>
<l>Fate would have sign'd my long release,</l>
<l>And Syntax would have died in peace;</l>
<l>Nor thus been robb'd, and tied and beaten,</l>
<l>And all alive by insects eaten."</l>

<l>But while he thus at Fate was railing,</l>
<l>And Fortune's angry frown bewailing,</l>
<l>A dog's approaching bark he hears;</l>
<l>'Twas sweet as music to his ears,</l>
<l>And soon a sure relief appears;</l>
<l>For, tho' it bore that gen'ral form,</l>
<l>Which oft, at home, foretold a storm,</l>
<l>It now appear'd an angel's shape,</l>
<l>That promis'd him a quick escape:</l>
<l>Nor did La Mancha's val'rous Knight</l>
<l>Feel greater pleasure at the sight,</l>
<l>When, overwhelm'd with love and awe,</l>
<l>His Dulcinea first he saw:</l>
<l>For on two trotting palfreys came,</l>
<l>And each one bore a comely dame:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>They started as his form they view;</l>
<l>The horses also started too:</l>
<l>The dog with insult seem'd to treat him,</l>
<l>And look'd as if he long'd to eat him.</l>
<l>In piteous tones he humbly pray'd</l>
<l>They'd turn aside, and give him aid;</l>
<l>When each leap'd quickly from her steed,</l>
<l>To join in charitable deed.</l>
<l>They drew their knives to cut the noose,</l>
<l>And let the mournful pris'ner loose;</l>
<l>With kindest words his fate bewail,</l>
<l>While grateful Syntax tells his tale.</l>
<l>The rustic matrons sooth his grief,</l>
<l>Nor offer, but afford relief;</l>
<l>And, turning from the beaten road,</l>
<l>Their well-lin'd panniers they unload;</l>
<l>When soon upon the bank appear'd</l>
<l>A sight his fainting spirits cheer'd:</l>
<l>They spread the fare with cheerful grace,</l>
<l>And gave a banquet to the place.</l>
<l>Most haply, too, as they untied him,</l>
<l>He saw his hat and wig beside him:</l>
<l>So, thus bewigg'd and thus behatted,</l>
<l>Down on the grass the Doctor squatted;</l>
<l>When he uplifted either eye,</l>
<l>With grateful accents to the sky.</l>
<l>"'Tis thus," he humbly said, "we read</l>
<l>In sacred books of heavenly deed:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And thus, I find in my distress,</l>
<l>The Manna of the Wilderness:</l>
<l>'Tis hermit's fare; but thanks to Heaven,</l>
<l>And those kind souls by whom 'tis given."</l>
<l>'Tis true that bread, and curds, and fruit,</l>
<l>Do with the pious hermits suits;</l>
<l>But Syntax surely was mistaken</l>
<l>To think their meals partake of bacon;</l>
<l>Or, that those reverend men regale,</l>
<l>As our good Doctors do-with ale;</l>
<l>And these kind dames, in nothing loth,</l>
<l>Took care that he partook of both.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>At length 'twas time to bit adieu,</l>
<l>And each their diff'rent way pursue:</l>
<l>A kind farewell, a kiss as kind,</l>
<l>He gave them both with heart and mind;</l>
<l>Then off he trudg'd, and, as he walk'd,</l>
<l>Thus to himself the Parson talk'd:</l>
<l>"'Tis well, I think, it is no worse,</l>
<l>For I have only lost my purse:</l>
<l>With all their cruelty and pains,</l>
<l>The rogues have got but trifling gains;</l>
<l>Poor four-and-four-pence is the measure</l>
<l>Of all their mighty pilfer'd treasure;</l>
<l>For haply there was no divining</l>
<l>I'd a snug pocket in my lining;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And, thanks to Spousy, ev'ry note</l>
<l>Was well sew'd up within my coat.</l>
<l>But where is Grizzle?-Never mind her;</l>
<l>I'll have her cried, and soon shall find her."</l>
<l>Thus he pursued the winding way,</l>
<l>Big with the evils of the day</l>
<l>Though the good Doctor kept in view</l>
<l>The favour of its blessings too.</l>
<l>Nor had he pac'd it half an hour,</l>
<l>Before he saw a parish tow'r,</l>
<l>And soon, with sore fatigue opprest,</l>
<l>An inn receiv'd him as its guest.</l>
<l>But still his mind, with anxious care,</l>
<l>Ponder'd upon his wand'ring mare;</l>
<l>He, therefore, sent the bellman round,</l>
<l>To see if Grizzle might be found.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Grizzle, ungrateful to her master,</l>
<l>And careless of his foul disaster,</l>
<l>Left him tied up, and took her way,</l>
<l>In hopes to meet with corn or hay;</l>
<l>But, as that did not come to pass,</l>
<l>She sought a meadow full of grass:</l>
<l>The farmer in the meadow found her,</l>
<l>And order'd John, his man, to pound her:</l>
<l>Now John was one of those droll folk,</l>
<l>Who oft take mischief for a joke;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>And thought 'twould make the master stare,</l>
<l>When he again beheld his mare,</l>
<l>(Perhaps the gem'man might be shockt)</l>
<l>To find her ready cropt and dockt:</l>
<l>At all events, he play'd his fun:</l>
<l>No sooner was it said than done.</l>
<l>But Grizzle was a patient beast,</l>
<l>And minded nought if she could feast:</l>
<l>Like many others, prone to think</l>
<l>The best of life was meat and drink,</l>
<l>Who feel to-day nor care nor sorrow,</l>
<l>If they are sure to feast to-morrow:</l>
<l>Thus Grizzle, as she pac'd around</l>
<l>The purlieu of the barren pound,</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>In hungry mood might seem to neigh-</l>
<l>"If I had water, corn, and hay,</l>
<l>I should not thus my fate bewail,</l>
<l>Nor mourn the loss of ears or tail."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>In the meantime, securely hous'd,</l>
<l>The Doctor booz'd it, and carous'd,</l>
<l>The Hostess spread her fairest cheer,</l>
<l>Her best beef-steak, her strongest beer;</l>
<l>And sooth'd him with her winning chat,</l>
<l>Of-"Pray eat this-and now take that.</l>
<l>Your Rev'rence, after all your fright,</l>
<l>Wants meat and drink to set you right."</l>
<l>His Rev'rence prais'd the golden rule,</l>
<l>Nor did he let his victuals cool;</l>
<l>And, having drunk his liquor out,</l>
<l>He took a turn to look about.</l>
<l>When to the folks about the door,</l>
<l>He told the dismal story o'er,</l>
<l>The country-people on him gaz'd,</l>
<l>And heard his perils all amaz'd:</l>
<l>How the thieves twin'd the cords around him</l>
<l>How to a tree the villains bound him!</l>
<l>What angels came to his relief.</l>
<l>To loose his bonds, and soothe his grief!</l>
<l>His loss of cash, and what was worse,</l>
<l>His saddle, saddle-bags, and horse!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus, as their rude attention hung</l>
<l>Upon the wonders of his tongue,</l>
<l>Lo! Grizzle's alter'd form appears,</l>
<l>With half its tail, and half its ears!</l>
<l>"Is there no law?" the Doctor cries:-</l>
<l>"Plenty," a lawyer straight replies:</l>
<l>"Employ me, and those thieves shall swing</l>
<l>On gallows-tree, in hempen-string:</l>
<l>And, for the rogue, the law shall flea him,</l>
<l>Who maim'd your horse, as now you see him."</l>
<l>"No," quoth the Don, "your pardon, pray;</l>
<l>I've had enough of thieves to-day:</l>
<l>I've lost four shillings and a groat,</l>
<l>But you would strip me of my coat;</l>
<l>And ears and tail won't fatten you,</l>
<l>You'll want the head and carcase too."</l>
<l>He chuckled as he made the stroke,</l>
<l>And all around enjoy'd the joke;</l>
<l>But still it was a sorry sight,</l>
<l>To see the beast in such a plight:</l>
<l>Yet what could angry Syntax do?</l>
<l>'Twas all in vain to fret and stew:</l>
<l>His well-stuff'd bags, with all their hoard</l>
<l>Of sketching-tools, were safe restor'd;</l>
<l>The saddle, too, which he had sought,</l>
<l>For small reward was quickly brought;</l>
<l>He therefore thought it far more sage,</l>
<l>To stop his threats and check his rage;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>So to the ostler's faithful care</l>
<l>He gave his mutilated mare:</l>
<l>And while poor Grizzle, free from danger,</l>
<l>Cropp'd the full rack and clean'd the manger,</l>
<l>Syntax, to ease his aching head,</l>
<l>Smok'd out his pipe, and went to bed.</l>
</lg></div>

<lg>
<l>Bless'd be the man,</l>
<l>said he of yore,</l>
<l>Who Quixote's lance</l>
<l>and target bore!</l>
<l>Bless'd be the man,</l>
<l>who first taught sleep</l>
<l>Throughout our wearied frames to cree[,</l>
<l>And kindly gave to human woes</l>
<l>The oblivious mantle of repose!</l>
<l>Hail! balmy power! that canst repair</l>
<l>The constant waste of human care;</l>
<l>To the sad heart afford relief,</l>
<l>And give a respite to its grief;</l>
<l>Canst calm, through night's composing hours,</l>
<l>The threat'ning storm that daily low'rs;</l>
<l>On the rude flint the wretched cheer,</l>
<l>And to a smile transform the tear!</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Thus wrapt in slumber Syntax lay--</l>
<l>Forgot the troubles of the day:</l>
<l>So sound his sleep, so sweet his rest,</l>
<l>By no disturbing dreams distrest;</l>
<l>That, all at ease, he lay entranc'd,</l>
<l>Till the fair morn was far advanc'd.</l>
<l>At length the hostess thought it wrong</l>
<l>He should be left to sleep so long;</l>
<l>So bid the maid to let him know</l>
<l>That breakfast was prepar'd below.</l>
<l>Betty then op'd the chamber door,</l>
<l>And tripping onwards 'cross the floor,</l>
<l>Undrew the curtains, one by one;</l>
<l>When, in a most ear-piercing tone,</l>
<l>Such as would grace the London cries,</l>
<l>She told him it was time to rise.</l>
<l>The noise his peaceful slumbers broke;</l>
<l>He gave a snort or two--and 'woke.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Now, as the Doctor turn'd his head,</l>
<l>Betty was court'sying by the bed:--</l>
<l>"What brought you here, fair maid, I pray?"</l>
<l>"To tell you, Sir, how wears the day;</l>
<l>And that it is my special care</l>
<l>To get your worship's morning fare.</l>
<l>The kettle boils, and I can boast</l>
<l>No small renown for making toast.</l>
<l>There's coffee, Sir, and tea, and meat,</l>
<l>And surely you must want to eat;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>For ten long hours have pass'd away,</l>
<l>Since down upon this bed you lay!"</l>
<l>The Doctor rubb'd his op'ning eyes,</l>
<l>Then stretch'd his arms, and 'gan to rise:</l>
<l>But Betty still demurely stands,</l>
<l>To hear him utter his commands.</l>
<l>"Be gone!" he cried, "get something nice,</l>
<l>And I'll be with you in a trice."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Behold him then, renew'd by rest,</l>
<l>His chin well shav'd, his peruke dress'd,</l>
<l>Conning with solemn air the news,</l>
<l>His welcome breakfast to amuse;</l>
<l>And when the well-fed meal was o'er,</l>
<l>Grizzle was order'd to the door;</l>
<l>Betty was also told to say,</l>
<l>The mighty sum there was to pay:</l>
<l>Betty, obedient to his will,</l>
<l>Her court'sy makes, and brings the bill.</l>
<l>Down the long page he cast his eye,</l>
<l>Then shook his head, and heav'd a sigh,</l>
<l>"What! am I doom'd, where'er I go,</l>
<l>In all I meet to find a foe?</l>
<l>Where'er I wander, to be cheated,</l>
<l>To be bambozled and ill-treated!"</l>
<l>Thus, as he read each item o'er,</l>
<l>The hostess op'd the parlour door;</l>
<l>When Syntax 'rose in solemn state,</l>
<l>And thus began the fierce debate:--</l>
</lg>

<div type="speech"><head>SYNTAX.</head>

<lg>
<l>"Good woman; here, your bill retake,</l>
<l>And, prithee, some abatement make;</l>
<l>I could not such demands afford,</l>
<l>Were I a bishp or a lord:</l>
<l>And though I hold myself as good</l>
<l>As any of my brotherhood,</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Howe'er, by bounteous Fortune crown'd,</l>
<l>In wealth and honours they abound,</l>
<l>It is not in my power to pay</l>
<l>Such long-drawn bills as well as they.</l>
<l>The paper fills me with affright;--</l>
<l>I surely do not read it right:</l>
<l>For at the bottom here, I see</l>
<l>Th' enormous total--one pound, three!"</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>HOSTESS.</head>
<lg>
<l>"The charges all are fairly made;</l>
<l>If you will eat, I must be paid.</l>
<l>My bills have never found reproaches</l>
<l>From lords and ladies, in their coaches,</l>
<l>This house, that's called the Royal Crown,</l>
<l>Is the first inn throughout the town:</l>
<l>The best of gentry, ev'ry day,</l>
<l>Become my guests and freely pay:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Besides, I took you in at night,</l>
<l>Half-dead, with hunger and affright,</l>
<l>Just 'scap'd from robbers."</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>SYNTAX.</head>

<lg>
<l>"That's most true,</l>
<l>And now I'm to be robb'd by you."</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>HOSTESS.</head>

<lg>
<l>"Sir, you mistake; and did not I</l>
<l>Disdain rude words, I'd say--you lie.</l>
<l>I took you in last night, I say,"--</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>SYNTAX</head>

<lg>
<l>"'Tis true;--and if this bill I pay,</l>
<l>You'll <emph rend="italic">take me in</emph> again to-day."</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>HOSTESS.</head>

<lg>
<l>"I gave you all my choicest cheer,</l>
<l>The best of meat, the best of beer;</l>
<l>And then you snor'd yourself to rest</l>
<l>In the best bed--I say the best.</l>
<l>You've had such tea as few can boast,</l>
<l>With a whole loaf turn'd into toast."</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>SYNTAX</head>

<lg>
<l>"And for your beef, and beer and tea,</l>
<l>You kindly charge me--one pound three!"</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>HOSTESS.</head>

<lg>
<l>"'Tis cheap as dirt--for well I know</l>
<l>How things with country curates go:</l>
<l>And I profess that I am loth</l>
<l>To deal unkindly with the cloth:</l>
<l>Nay, oft and oft, as I'm a sinner,</l>
<l>I've given hungry clerks a dinner."</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>SYNTAX</head>

<lg>
<l>"And there's a proverb, as they say,</l>
<l>That for the clerks the parsons pay;</l>
<l>Which you, I trow, can well fulfil,</l>
<l>Whene'er you make a parson's bill.</l>
<l>Why, one pound three, the truth I speak,</l>
<l>Would keep my household for a week.</l>
<l>Dear Mrs. Syntax, how she'd vapour,</l>
<l>Were she to read this curious paper!"</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>HOSTESS.</head>

<lg>
<l>"If that's your living, on my life,</l>
<l>You starve your servants and your wife."</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>SYNTAX</head>

<lg>
<l>"I wish my wife were here to meet you,</l>
<l>In your own fashion she would greet you:</l>
<l>With looks as fierce, and voice as shrill,</l>
<l>She'd make you, mistress, change your bill."</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>HOSTESS.</head>

<lg>
<l>"Think you besides, there's nought to pay</l>
<l>For all your horse's corn and hay?</l>
<l>And ointments, too, to cure the ail</l>
<l>Of her cropp'd ears and mangled tail?"</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>SYNTAX</head>

<lg>
<l>"I wish the wight would bring the shears</l>
<l>Which dock'd that tail and cropp'd those ears,</l>
<l>And just exert the self-same skill</l>
<l>To crop and dock your monstrous bill!</l>
<l>But, I'm in haste to get away,</l>
<l>Though one pound three I will not pay:</l>
<l>So, if you'll take one-half th' amount,</l>
<l>We'll quickly settle the account.</l>
<l>There is your money:--do you see?</l>
<l>And let us part in charity."</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="speech"><head>HOSTESS.</head>

<lg>
<l>"Well, as a charitable deed,</l>
<l>I'll e'en consent--so mount your steed,</l>
<l>And on your journey straight proceed:</l>
<l>But well you know, where'er you roam,</l>
<l>That Charity begins at home."</l>
</lg></div>

<div type="canto" n="5"><head>Canto V.</head>

<lg>
<l>The Doctor smil'd, the</l>
<l>bill was paid,</l>
<l>The hostess left him to</l>
<l>the maid;</l>
<l>When Betty stood in humble guise,</l>
<l>With expectation in her eyes,</l>
<l>That he was surely so good-hearted,</l>
<l>To give her something ere they parted.</l>
<l>Now, Nature, in her wanton freaks,</l>
<l>Had given Betty rosy cheeks;</l>
<l>And caus'd her raven locks to break</l>
<l>In native ringlets on her neck:</l>
<l>The roving bee might wish to sip</l>
<l>The sweetness of her pouting lip;</l>
<l>So red, so tempting to the view,</l>
<l>'Twas what the Doctor long'd to do.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"You're a nice girl," he smiling said;</l>
<l>"Am I?" replied the simp'ring maid.</l>
<l>"I swear you are, and if you're willing</l>
<l>To give a kiss, I'll give a shilling."</l>
<l>"If 'tis the same thing, Sir, to you,</l>
<l>Make the gift two-fold, and take two."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>He grimly grinn'd, with inward pleasure,</l>
<l>And instant seiz'd the purchas'd treasure.</l>
<l>"Your lips, my dear, are sweet as honey:</l>
<l>So one smack more--and there's your money."</l>
<l>This charming ceremony o'er,</l>
<l>The Parson strutted to the door;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Where his poor wounded mare appears,</l>
<l>In cruel state of tail and ears.</l>
<l>The neighbors all impatient wait,</l>
<l>To see him issue from the gate;</l>
<l>For country-town or village-green</l>
<l>Had seldom such a figure seen.</l>
<l>Labour stood still to see him pass,</l>
<l>While ev'ry lad and ev'ry lass</l>
<l>Ran forward to enjoy the feast,</l>
<l>To jeer the sage, and mourn the beast.</l>
<l>But, one and all, aloud declare,</l>
<l>'Twas a fit sight for country-fair;</l>
<l>Far better than a dancing bear.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>At length, escap'd from all the noise</l>
<l>Of women, men, and girls and boys,</l>
<l>In the recesses of a lane</l>
<l>He thus gave utt'rance to his pain:--</l>
<l>"It seems to be my luckless case,</l>
<l>At ev'ry point, in every place,</l>
<l>To meet with trouble and disgrace.</l>
<l>But yesterday I left my home,</l>
<l>In search of fancied wealth to roam;</l>
<l>And nought, I think, but ills betide me</l>
<l>Sure, some foul spirit runs beside me;</l>
<l>Some blasting demon from the east,</l>
<l>A deadly foe to man and beast,</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>That loves to riot in disaster,</l>
<l>And plague alike both horse and master.</l>
<l>Grizzle, who full five years and more</l>
<l>A trumpeter in triumph bore;</l>
<l>Who had in hard-fought battle been,</l>
<l>And many a bloody conflict seen;</l>
<l>Who having 'scap'd with scarce a scar,</l>
<l>'Mid all the angry threats of war;</l>
<l>When her best days are almost past,</l>
<l>Feels these ignoble wounds at last.</l>
<l>Ah! what can thy fond master do?</l>
<l>He's cut and slash'd as well as you.</l>
<l>But, though no more with housing gay,</l>
<l>And prancing step, you take your way;</l>
<l>Or, with your stately rider, lead</l>
<l>The armed troop to warlike deed;</l>
<l>While you've a leg you ne'er shall cease</l>
<l>To bear the minister of peace.</l>
<l>Long have you borne him, nor e'er grumbled,</l>
<l>Nor ever started, kick'd or stumbled."</l>
<l>But mildest natures sometimes err</l>
<l>From the strict rules of character:</l>
<l>The tim'rous bird defends its young,</l>
<l>And beasts will kick when they are stung.</l>
<l>'Twas burning hot, and hosts of flies,</l>
<l>With venom'd stings, around them rise:</l>
<l>They seiz'd on Grizzle's wounded part,</l>
<l>Who straight began to snort and start;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>Kick'd up behind, rear'd up before,</l>
<l>And play'd a dozen antics more:</l>
<l>The Doctor coax'd, but all in vain,</l>
<l>She snorted, kick'd, and rear'd again:</l>
<l>"Alas!" said Syntax, "could I pop</l>
<l>Just now, upon a blacksmith's shop,</l>
<l>Whose cooling unguent would avail</l>
<l>To save poor Grizzle's ears and tail!"</l>
<l>When scarce had he his wishes spoke,</l>
<l>Than he beheld a cloud of smoke,</l>
<l>That from a forge appear'd to rise,</l>
<l>And for a moment veil'd the skies,</l>
<l>While rude the hammers to his ear</l>
<l>Proclaim'd the aid he wish'd was near.</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>By the way-side the cottage rose,</l>
<l>Around it many a willow grows,</l>
<l>Where Syntax, in a tone of grief,</l>
<l>Shew'd Grizzle's wounds, and pray'd relief.</l>
<l>The sooty Galen soon appear'd,</l>
<l>And with fair hopes the Doctor cheer'd.</l>
<l>"Trust me, good Sir, I've got a plaster,</l>
<l>Will cure the beast of her disaster;</l>
<l>And, while the dressing I prepare,</l>
<l>With all becoming skill and care,</l>
<l>You in that arbour may regale,</l>
<l>With a cool pipe and jug of ale:</l>
<l>I've long a two-fold trade profess'd,</l>
<l>And med'cine sell for man and beast."</l>
<l>Syntax now sought the cooling shade,</l>
<l>While Galen's dame the banquet made:</l>
<l>She well knew how her guests to please,</l>
<l>And added meat, and bread, and cheese:</l>
<l>Besides, she told the village-tale--</l>
<l>Who came to drink her home-brew'd ale;</l>
<l>How that the laughter-loving Vicar</l>
<l>Would sometimes walk to taste their liquor</l>
<l>That their gay landlord was renown'd,</l>
<l>For hunting fox, with horns and hound;</l>
<l>That he'd a daughter passing fair,</l>
<l>Who was his honour's only heir;</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But she was proud, nor could a squire</l>
<l>Approach to tell his am'rous fire;</l>
<l>A lord alone, as it was said,</l>
<l>She would receive into her bed.</l>
<l>Throughout the village, ev'ry name</l>
<l>Became a subject for the dame;</l>
<l>And thus she play'd her chatt'ring part,</l>
<l>Till Syntax thought it time to start.</l>
<l>And now poor Grizzle re-appears,</l>
<l>With plaster'd tail, and plaster'd ears,</l>
<l>Which thus cas'd up, might well defy</l>
<l>The sharpest sting of gnat or fly.</l>
<l>The Doctor having had his fill,</l>
<l>Without a word discharg'd his bill;</l>
<l>But, as it was the close of day,</l>
<l>He trotted briskly on his way;</l>
<l>And ere the sun withdrew his light,</l>
<l>An inn receiv'd him for the night,</l>
<l>His frame fatigu'd, his mind oppress'd,</l>
<l>He tiff'd his punch, and went to rest.</l>
<l>The morning came, when he arose</l>
<l>In spirits from his calm repose;</l>
<l>And while the maid prepar'd the tea,</l>
<l>He look'd around the room to see</l>
<l>What story did the walls disclose</l>
<l>Of human joys, of human woes.</l>
<l>The window quickly caught his eye,</l>
<l>On whose clear panes he could descry</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>The motley works of many a Muse:</l>
<l>There was enough to pick and choose;</l>
<l>And, "Faith!" said he, "I'll strive to hook</l>
<l>Some of these lines into my book:</l>
<l>For here there are both grave and witty,</l>
<l>And some, I see, are rather pretty."</l>
<l>From a small pocket in his coat</l>
<l>He drew his tablets,--when he wrote</l>
<l>Whate'er the pregnant panes possess'd;</l>
<l>And these choice lays among the rest:</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"If my fond breast were made of glass,</l>
<l>And you could see what there doth pass,</l>
<l>Kitty, my ever charming fair!</l>
<l>You'd see your own sweet image there."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"I once came here a freebooting,</l>
<l>And on this fine manor went shooting,</l>
<l>And if the 'Squire this truth denies,</l>
<l>This glass shall tell the 'Squire--he lies."</l>

<l>"Dolly's as fat as any sow,</l>
<l>And, if I'm not mistaken,</l>
<l>Dolly is well dispos'd, I trow,</l>
<l>To trim her husband's bacon."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"Dear Jenny, while your name I hear,</l>
<l>No transient glow my bosom heats;</l>
<l>And when I meet your eye, my dear,</l>
<l>My flutt'ring heart no longer beats.</l>
<l>I dream, but I no longer find</l>
<l>Your form still present to my view;</l>
<l>I wake, but now my vacant mind</l>
<l>No longer, waking, dreams of you.</l>
<l>I can find maids, in ev'ry rout,</l>
<l>With smiles as false and forms as fine;</l>
<l>But you must hunt the world throughout,</l>
<l>To find a heart as true as mine."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>"I hither came down</l>
<l>From fair London town,</l>
<l>With Lucy so mild and so kind;</l>
<l>But Lucy grew cool,</l>
<l>And call'd me a fool,</l>
<l>So I started and left her behind."</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>But as he copied, quite delighted,</l>
<l>All that the Muse had thus indited,</l>
<l>A hungry dog, and prone to steal,</l>
<l>Ran off with half his breakfast meal;</l>
<l>While Dolly, ent'ring with a kettle,</l>
<l>Was follow'd by a man of mettle,</l>
<l>Who swore he'd have the promis'd kiss;</l>
<l>And, as he seiz'd the melting bliss,</l>
</lg>
<lg>
<l>From the hot, ill-pois'd kettle's spout,</l>
<l>The boiling stream came pouring out,</l>
<l>Which drove the Doctor from the Muse,</l>
<l>By quickly filling both his shoes.</l>
