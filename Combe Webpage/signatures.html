         <h1>Signatures Analysis</h1>
         <p>The column The Modern Spectator is based on an earlier publication, The Spectator which
            was published in the early 1700s. William Combe seems to have revived the spirit of that
            original column with fictional letters from readers embedded in commentary from the
            Modern Spectator. Since Combe had a penchant for writing letters in various characters,
            especially females, we decided to pull a list of all the signatures to see if there are
            any that are distinctly different from the others. It will be interesting to see if any
            are plausible names and eventually do research to see if there were people in existence
            attached to those names. Prior to this project, that would have involved going through
            copies of the Repository, looking up each column, and reading through the column to see
            if it contained a letter and noting the signature, a time consuming process. </p>
