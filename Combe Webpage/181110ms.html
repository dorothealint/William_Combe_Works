               <h1>THE MODERN SPECTATOR No. VII</h1>
               <h2>1811-10 :Pages 206-211</h2>
               <p>Last week was married at Snoring church, in this country, Mr. Snow to Miss Frost. </p>
               <p>Hail, wedded love!</p> A Country Newspaper. <p>I OFFER the following letter
                  without any prefatory remarks to my readers.</p>
               <p>Mr. SPECTATOR, </p>
               <p>I have somewhere read of a good woman, who, on coming from church after she had
                  been married, exclaimed most emphatically, “Thank heaven! the troublesome business
                  of love is now at an end.” It has also been said, in the same spirit, that lovers
                  are no less altered by marriage than drunken men are by sleep. </p>
               <p>I have also frequently seen a pair of prints which represents the latter opinion
                  in a more striking manner than words can possibly describe. They were published at
                  a period when the art of engraving was not brought to its present state of
                  perfection: but though they would not be suffered to appear in the windows of Mr.
                  Ackermann’s shop, where I have so often been, and the passing crowds are so
                  continually arrested to view its attractive display of art, taste, and beauty,
                  these inferior productions, nevertheless, tell their story with considerable
                  effect, though fitted only for the walls of a country alehouse, or the stall of a
                  country fair. </p>
               <p>The titles of these two pictures are Before Marriage and After Marriage. The scene
                  is the same in both: it is entirely rural, and consists of a field with a path
                  through it, a thick hedge, a spreading oak, a lofty, awkward stile, and a distant
                  view of the country. The living characters are a young lady and gentleman, who are
                  to be supposed as taking a lover’s walk. </p>
               <p>In the first this happy pair are seen passing the stile, and nothing can exceed
                  the tender, assiduous care with which the fond Damon assists his beloved Lucinda
                  in clearing the difficulties of this troublesome barrier, while she appears to
                  display a modest pride from the attentions of her enamoured swain. The companion
                  print exhibits the same persons, the same stile, and the same scenery; but the
                  acting characters, who are supposed to be man and wife, and may have been so for
                  three weeks or a month, are already in a state of separation. She is clambering
                  over the stile, at the risk of breaking her legs, and calling in vain assistance;
                  while he appears to be walking at some distance before her, and whistling for want
                  of thought; or if he has any, the late adorable object of his everlasting
                  tenderness and unchangeable affection, does not seem to occupy an atom of it. </p>
               <p>I first saw these pictures in a cake-shop when I was a boy at school, and having
                  made them the subject of an exercise, the master on reading it clapped me on the
                  head, and prognosticated that I should die an old bachelor. I must, however,
                  observe by the way, that the learned doctor himself was so far from being one of
                  those inattentive husbands, that it was evident to all his scholars, as well as to
                  the whole neighbourhood, that he practised the most submissive obedience to a very
                  imperious wife: so that the boys, whenever he thought it proper to scourge them,
                  felt a vindictive satisfaction in the reflection, that in the course of
                  twenty-four hours at least Mrs. Thwackem would avenge them by one or other of her
                  domestic chastisements. </p>
               <p>This vaticination of my sage Merlin of a schoolmaster has been fulfilled as far as
                  I have hitherto proceeded in the journey of life. I am as yet a single man, and my
                  own opinion is, that I shall continue to keep at a very respectful distance from
                  the hymeneal alter. I must, however, acknowledge when I have been told by some of
                  my new-married friends what an uncomfortable life I appear to lead, that I have
                  begun to waver a little in my partiality to a single state; but, on the other
                  hand, when some of my old-married acquaintance have declared what an enviable life
                  mine was, I have been confirmed in my design to go a bachelor to my grave. In this
                  resolution I have lately been more than ever confirmed by the conduct of a near
                  relation of mine, who was brought up to the sea and was very fond of his
                  profession: he, however, happened to marry a very pretty woman, with a very
                  handsome fortune, when he retired into the country with his charming bride, spoke
                  with disregard of a naval life, and, having got such a warm matrimonial birth, he
                  hoped never to see the inside of a ship’s cabin again as long as he lived.
                  Nevertheless, after he had enjoyed the undisturbed felicity of rural life, and the
                  delights of connubial love, for about eighteen months, he came up to town, and, on
                  my calling to see him, I was informed, to my extreme astonishment, that he was
                  gone to the Admiralty to solicit a ship. On my meeting him the next day, he said
                  that a life of indolence was unbecoming a man; that, in the present state of the
                  country, it was disgraceful for a sailor to withhold his services; and that the
                  most delightful thing in the world was a frigate and a cruise. </p>
               <p>Such being my situation, it may be thought by certain unreflecting people, that I
                  am not qualified to treat a subject of which matrimony forms the principal
                  feature. This I shall, without the least reserve, take upon me to deny. I may not,
                  it is true, be able to write from experimental facts; but I may be capable surely
                  of forming an adequate judgment from attentive and unprejudiced observation. I
                  bear no hostility to the wedded life as such: on the contrary, I believe it, when
                  accompanied with pure love, perfect confidence, and similarity of disposition, to
                  be the real heaven upon earth. But then, I know also, that when it is composed of
                  different ingredients, which, according to my view of things, too often happens,
                  it produces a very opposite condition, which I shall not venture to describe. This
                  reflection so affects my nerves, which are not very strong, that I tremble at the
                  idea of entering into a state whose happiness is so uncertain, and whose ordinary
                  inconvenienies I have not the strength to encounter. </p>
               <p>I am well aware, for it has never been my habit to be satisfied with superficial
                  speculations, that matrimony is not only essential to the support, but the good
                  order and happiness, of civil society. Thus matrimony forms families which could
                  not be formed without it, and families form states which could not be formed
                  without them. It was the first natural union which preceded and prepared mankind
                  for civil union; and the bonds of the second union were more effectually
                  strengthened by those paternal and filial affection and consanguinity, than they
                  could have been by those alone of accidental interests liable to vary, and of
                  covenants liable to be broken. </p>
               <p>On such principles, and for such purposes, matrimony was instituted. This is my
                  opinion, and if I were certain that I should produce heroes, or statesmen, or
                  philosophers, men who would be eminently useful in society, I would take the first
                  opportunity of changing my condition, and risk all domestic consequences for the
                  sake of my country; but with such a puny frame and fine-strung nerves as nature
                  has given me, with my habits of study and sentimental cast of character, I have
                  more than a shrewd suspicion, that my offspring would be fit only to form
                  petit-maitres and men milliners; a class of people, who, if they were banished
                  from the world, it would be the better for their dismission. It is not, I repeat
                  it, from any aversion to the married state, that I keep at an awful distance from
                  the temple of Hymen. On the contrary, I reverence his rites, though I am not one
                  of his immediate votaries. It is not that I am indifferent to women, for I find
                  the principal charm of life in their society. In short, I do not venture into the
                  matrimonial lottery from the trembling apprehension that I should draw a blank, or
                  which is equally probable, be a blank myself. </p>
               <p>Plato has a very beautiful allegory on love and marriage, which will illustrate my
                  feelings on these important subjects in a much better manner than I can do it for
                  myself. </p>
               <p>Mankind, as fabulously presumed by that amiable, benevolent, but fanciful,
                  philosopher, were not, in their original state, divided into male and female as at
                  present; but each individual person was a compound of both sexes, and was in
                  himself both husband and wife, melted down into one living creature. This union
                  must have been, under such supposition, perfect and entire, and the parts
                  admirably adjusted together, since there resulted an uninterrupted harmony between
                  the male and female, although they were thus compelled to be inseparable
                  companions. In short, says the fable, so great was the happiness flowing from it,
                  that these MEN-WOMEN, as Plato calls them, became insolent upon their prosperity,
                  and rebelled against the gods. To punish them for their temerity, Jupiter could
                  contrive no better expedient than to divorce the male part from the female, and
                  make two imperfect beings of the compound, which was before so perfect. Hence the
                  origin of men and women as distinct creatures. But notwithstanding this division,
                  so lively is our remembrance of the happiness which we enjoyed in our primeval
                  state, that we are never at rest in this situation; but each of these halves is
                  continually searching through the whole species to find the other half which was
                  broken from it, and when they meet they join again with the greatest fondness and
                  sympathy. But it too often happens that they are mistaken in this particular, so
                  that they take for their half what in no way corresponds with them, and then the
                  parts do not meet nor join in with each other, as is usual in fractures. In this
                  case the union is soon dissolved, and each part is set loose again to hunt for its
                  lost half, joining itself to every one whom it meets by way of trial; and enjoying
                  no rest till its perfect sympathy with its partner shews that it has, at last,
                  been successful in its endeavours. </p>
               <p>From this very ingenious fable Dr. Watts borrowed the thought on which he has
                  founded his little poem entitled Few happy Matches; and Hume has carried on and
                  completed this fiction of the Greek philosopher with his characteristic ingenuity,
                  and in the following manner: </p>
               <p>When Jupiter had separated the male from the female, and had quelled their pride
                  and ambition by so severe an operation, he repented of the cruelty of his
                  resentment, and compassionated the situation of poor mortals, who were now become
                  incapable of repose or tranquility. Such cravings, anxieties, and necessities
                  arose, as made them curse their creation, and think existence itself a punishment.
                  In vain had they recourse to every other occupation and amusement. In vain did
                  they seek after every pleasure of sense and refinement of reason. Nothing could
                  fill that void which they felt in their hearts, or supply the loss of their
                  partner, who was so fatally separated from them. To remedy this disorder, and to
                  bestow some comfort, at least, on the human race in their forlorn situation,
                  Jupiter sent down Love and Hymen to collect the broken halves of mankind, and to
                  piece them together in the best possible manner. These two deities found suck a
                  prompt disposition in mankind to unite again in their primitive state, that they
                  proceeded on their work, for some time, with the most uninterrupted success; till,
                  at last, from various unlucky accidents, a dissention arose between them. The
                  chief counsellor and favourite of Hymen was Care, who was continually filling his
                  patron’ head with prospects of futurity, such as settlements, family, children,
                  and domestic arrangements, so that little else was regarded in all the matches
                  they made. On the other hand, Love had chosen Pleasure for his favourite, who
                  proved as pernicious a counsellor as the other, and would never allow Love to look
                  beyond the present momentary gratification or the satisfying the prevailing
                  inclination. These two favourites became, in a very short time, irreconcileable
                  enemies, and made it their chief business to undermine each other in all the
                  undertakings. No sooner had Love fixed upon two halves, which he was cementing
                  together and forming to a close union, than Care insinuates himself, and, bringing
                  Hymen along with him, dissolves the union produced by Love, and joins each half to
                  some other half which he had provided for it. To be revenged of this insidious
                  conduct, Pleasure creeps in upon a pair already joined by Hymen, and calling Love
                  to his assistance, they underhand contrive to join each half by secret links to
                  halves with which Hymen was wholly unacquainted. It was not long before this
                  quarrel was felt in its pernicious consequences; and such complaints arose before
                  the throne of Jupiter, that he ordered the offending parties to be summoned before
                  him, when, after hearing the pleadings on both sides, he ordered an immediate
                  reconciliation betwixt Love and Hymen, as the only expedient for giving happiness
                  to mankind. And that he might be sure this reconciliation should be durable, he
                  laid his injunctions on them, never to join any halves without consulting Care and
                  Pleasure, and the obtaining the consent of both to the conjunction. Where this
                  order is strictly observed the two beings combine to form one happy creature. </p>
               <p>Such are the principles, and such the chances, on which matrimonial happiness is
                  founded. I acknowledge the former, but I have not nerve enough to risk the latter.
                  But it may be asked of me, how I, who pretend to fulfil the duties of life, can
                  venture to acknowledge a disobedience to that essential command which tells me to
                  increase and multiply. I have, however, my answer at hand in the form of a younger
                  brother, who is about to be married, not only with my consent, but by my desire. I
                  propose to settle very handsomely on the marriage, and shall leave my fortune to
                  the issue of it. I, therefore, Mr. Spectator, hope you will be of opinion, that I
                  shall have fulfilled this great end of my creation, by qualifying honest Jack to
                  do that for me which I feel such an apprehension of doing for myself; and that,
                  under these circumstances, I may hope to die in peace, though I die </p>
