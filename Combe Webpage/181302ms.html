                  <p>A curious wish which did corrupt their will. </p>

               <p>The word curiosity, as applied to an object, cannot fail to excite an agreeable
                  sensation, as it suggests the desire or expectation of receiving satisfaction or
                  improvement. Thus the curiosities of the Tower, or Westminster Abbey, or Salmon’s
                  Wax-Work, or Bullock’s Museum, offer to different ages and characters a pleasing
                  and useful source of information. But when we apply this self-same word to a
                  disposition of the mind, we do not always feel a similar sensation; and, perhaps,
                  among all the troublesome neighbours with which a quiet, studious, inoffensive man
                  may be pestered, curiosity is the most disagreeable; and though it cannot be
                  classed among the defined catalogue of human vices, its operations are sometimes
                  attended with the most malignant and even fatal consequences. I shall not enter
                  into the examination of those causes which have so generally led to the opinion,
                  that this principle of curiosity, when considered as a failing, is unreservedly
                  applied to the lovely sex. But so it appears to be; and with all my regard for
                  those ornaments of creation called women, and indebted as I am for the chief
                  happiness of my life to one of them, I cannot altogether deny, that there is
                  something more than plausibility in the imputation. I shall not enter into
                  distinctions that may appear invidious or illiberal; but the fact is, that when we
                  speak of a man of curiosity, and a woman of curiosity, two very opposite
                  characters are generally understood. It marks a spirit of scientific research and
                  enquiry in the one sex; while, I fear, it describes in the other an anxiety to pry
                  into affairs in which they have no allowable concern themselves. But to proceed a
                  little further on this interesting, but tender topic: there is a similar
                  difference in the terms, a curious man and a curious woman. The former excites the
                  idea of a person distinguished by some odd peculiarities of character or conduct;
                  while the latter adds nothing to, or diminishes nothing from, the female
                  disposition to which I have already ventured to allude. </p>
               <p>The account which the following letter contains, in much simplicity of narrative,
                  and no common testimony of facts in its support, appears to confirm my
                  introductory observations; and I cannot deny the reasonableness of the complaints
                  which accompany it: at the same time, I am fully prepared to receive from any of
                  my fair correspondents such arguments against my present opinion, as their
                  cultivated minds and fascinating pens may be pleased to produce; and shall
                  consider a conviction of my error, under the influence of their reasoning, as an
                  improvement of my understanding, and consequently as an addition to the happiness
                  of my life. </p>
               <p>TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR. SIR, </p>
               <p>I am a gentleman of studious character, scientific pursuits, and independent
                  fortune. My residence is in a narrow street, in a retired part of the town, which
                  I preferred from the circumstance of a large house and handsome gardens, and some
                  other conveniences suited to my favourite occupations, which the more fashionable
                  districts could not afford me.—But I hasten to the subject of my complaint, and
                  the cause of this intrusion upon you. </p>
               <p>I have already observed, that the street where I have taken up my residence, and
                  propose to pass some years of my life, is narrow. Indeed, so limited is the
                  breadth of it, that it is no difficult matter for any of its inhabitants, if they
                  should be so disposed, to make themselves acquainted with the concerns of their
                  opposite neighbors. </p>
               <p>This leading point being settled, I must beg leave to inform you, that the family
                  who occupy the house immediately opposite to mine, seem to have little or no
                  employment, but in watching my door, and peeping into the several rooms of my
                  house which front the street. This they do with a regularity and a perseverance
                  sufficient almost to justify a suspicion, that some real and most essential
                  benefit was derived to them from their unremitting vigilance. Indeed, they carry
                  their curiosity to such an extraordinary degree of minuteness, that they are not
                  merely content with flying to their windows whenever there is a rap at my door;
                  but, as my laundry is at the top of the house, they will mount to their garrets to
                  examine the periodical occupations of it. But before I proceed to give a more
                  particular detail of their proceedings, I shall endeavour to present you with an
                  account of the parties from whom they originate. </p>
               <p>This family consists of Mr., Mrs., and the two Miss Quicksights; an old and a
                  young female servant, with a little smart girl of about ten years of age, who is
                  said to be the grandchild of the elderly domestic; a circumstance on which I shall
                  make no other observation, but that none of the neighbours believe it, and that
                  the milkman who serves both families, has figuratively declared to my wife’s femme
                  de chambre, a very chattering kind of body, that the girl is as like the eldest
                  miss as two drops of cream. But this by the way. </p>
               <p>Mr. Quicksight is an elderly man, of a very decent appearance; his good lady seems
                  to be at least as old as himself, but dresses rather smart for her time of life.
                  The two Miss Quicksights have little to boast as to figure or beauty, but they are
                  very attentive to the changes of fashion, and constantly appear in all cuts and
                  colours of it. Our Kitty Pry, whom I have already mentioned, and who will
                  sometimes tell a bit of news of our neighbours, in spite of the continual
                  prohibitions of her mistress, positively asserts, that they make all their dresses
                  themselves, which I think is much to their honour, though probably they may not be
                  of the same opinion; but however that may be, they never fail to be the smartest
                  figures in the chapel which we frequent, and from whose morning duties they never
                  absent themselves. </p>
               <p>The father of this family is seldom at home; he goes out soon after breakfast, and
                  seldom returns till the hour of dinner; and within an hour after his meal, he
                  issues forth again, rather better dressed, as it may be supposed, to some evening
                  club or coffee-house. They sometimes have company, and whenever that is the case,
                  their windows are thrown open to let the neighbors see the preparations that they
                  are making, and the quantity of plate that is brought forth on the occasion, and
                  in no common abundance. Kitty Pry says, that Mr. Quicksight has been a
                  silversmith, and that this display is the remains of his stock in trade. She also
                  has been informed, that at these entertainments a journeyman watchmaker officiates
                  as a servant out of livery. This talkative minx has also another pretty little
                  opinion, which is, that this poor man must be glad to get out of his house, as she
                  is sure he has a terrible life among them; for that on Sundays they stuff out his
                  pockets with their prayer-books, and, if it looks like rain, they send him forward
                  with all their umbrellas. </p>
               <p>As for the ladies, against whom I have to make my complaint, their principal
                  employment seems to be that of watching every circumstance without my house, and,
                  as far as their penetrating eyes can reach, every thing that passes within it. If
                  my door is saluted with a single rap, it is a summons for one or other of them to
                  come to the window; but if the signal should be of a more gentlemanly sound, then
                  the two misses never fail to appear; and if a coach should stop, then the mother
                  is sure to be of the party. It was but yesterday that I happened to be at the
                  window, when the carriage of a noble lord who sometimes does me the honour of a
                  visit, stopped at my door, with a notification at it that thundered throughout the
                  neighbourhood: This important event happened at the moment when the Quicksights
                  were at dinner; and the whole family instantly appeared at the windows, and, as it
                  seemed, in such haste, that they came with their mouths full of meat; so that they
                  continued, father, and mother, and misses, looking with all their eyes, and
                  chewing with all their jaws, at least till the arrival of my visitor drew my
                  attention to a better object. It might be almost supposed that a kind of
                  sympathetic impulse existed between the knocker of my door and the heads of the
                  opposite neighbours of mine. But this curiosity never gave me any concern; my
                  wife, who is a woman of superior understanding, used sometimes to pity the folly
                  of it; and we never considered this idle attention to our concerns with the least
                  sense of displeasure, till, from a particular circumstance, I began to suspect,
                  and some subsequent, as well as very peculiar information convinced me, that an
                  envious malignity was blended with their over curious attention to us. </p>
               <p>It has long been a practice with me to give an handsome dinner every Sunday to my
                  literary friends, and I seldom have less than a dozen persons of learning and
                  science at my table on that day: but as my invitations are not particularly
                  addressed to men of fashion and fortune, but to those who are distinguished by
                  intellectual eminence; and as it too frequently happens, that such persons are not
                  so much the favourites of Plutus as they are of Apollo, and not so attentive to
                  exterior appearance as to interior attainments, my visitors are sometimes, in
                  their figure and fashion, not exactly suited to the fancy of young ladies, who
                  judge of a man from the cut of his pantaloons. </p>
               <p>Sunday, therefore, was a day of great curiosity to the Quicksight family; and as
                  my company arrive, they make their observations, let loose their shoutings, and
                  indulge their laughter, in a way that is not only unpolite, but actually illiberal
                  and indecent. One of my particular friends, whom I see frequently, and can never
                  see too often, at my weekly table, is unfortunately very deformed; but those who
                  know him, lose all sense of the imperfection of his figure in the perfections of
                  his mind. It came to my knowledge, very accidentally, that in the last spring,
                  when these misses had thrown open their windows for a more complete indulgence of
                  their reigning propensity, they offered their insults, and indulged their mockery,
                  on this excellent man’s unhappy shape, with so little reserve, that it must have
                  reached his ears, as it did those of every casual passenger. He probably pitied
                  their folly, and forgot it; for it was not from him that I received the intimation
                  of such unfeeling ribaldry. </p>
               <p>I was not without a sense of resentment at this abominable conduct, but I thought
                  that a complaint to the offending parties would rather gratify their malignity
                  than remedy the evil, so I let it pass on and continue without any apparent
                  attention from me. My life, I thank Heaven, is too happy to be disturbed, and my
                  pursuits too important to be interrupted, by such ignorant vagaries. I have,
                  however, lately discovered, that these idle, silly, vulgar people, not only watch
                  every action of me and my family, count and observe upon every person who comes to
                  my door, but that they make regular minutes of every thing they see, in a daily
                  register, and accompany these curious items with such observations as may be
                  suggested by their low minds, uncultivated understandings, and envious
                  dispositions. </p>
               <p>It so happened that my baker, who also serves the Quicksights in that necessary
                  capacity, received a cake from the little girl in that family, with orders to bake
                  it with great care. It was closely covered with a sheet of paper, and the baker
                  happened to see my name upon it, shewed it to my cook, whose curiosity induced
                  her, very unceremoniously, to strip the gateau of its clothing, and hurry into the
                  kitchen; where its contents underwent, I need not say, a very severe examination;
                  for it was discovered, that the servants were treated with as little reserve as
                  their master and mistress. This paper proved to be a loose sheet of the Quicksight
                  Diary, which had thus accidentally come into the possession of the very persons
                  who were certainly not intended to have been favoured with the perusal of it. </p>
               <p>I shall hope to amuse you with a specimen of this extraordinary family
                  journal.</p>
               <p>”THE BONHAMS.</p>
               <p>”Saturday, May 1.—Nobody called all this morning but tradesmen, who all seemed to
                  have very dunning faces. Some people had better lay down their coach, and pay poor
                  honest people what they owe them. </p>
               <p>”Mrs. B-------- went out in her carriage at one: she looks very mild, and gentle,
                  and all that: but I much doubt her gentleness; for the children, who are charming
                  little cherubs, look, poor things, as if they were very ill treated.—Ordered to
                  drive to Kensington Gardens. To be sure we must appear to be persons of fashion! </p>
               <p>”Not a creature called during the evening.—A pretty stupid tete-a-tete, I’ll
                  warrant you. </p>
               <p>”Sunday.—The Bonhams all walk to church, with their servants in their cock’d hats
                  and best liveries.—A pretty deal of pride with all this humility! </p>
               <p>”Sunday is the grand dinner day: a fine Christian way of keeping the Sabbath, with
                  their stuffing, and guttling, and drinking!—Their usual ragamuffin company came
                  from four till five. The ordinary succession of rusty black coats, shabby hats,
                  and oil-skin umbrellas. A gentleman arrived late, very well dressed; the coach
                  very handsome—who can he be?—The lady with him a fashionable-looking woman, rather
                  handsome; but if she does not paint red and white, I don’t know the colour of
                  chalk and brickdust.—Who can these people be? The company staid late: as Fusty
                  Bonham had, for once, got a gentleman to dine with him, he was determined to keep
                  him as long as he could. </p>
               <p>”Monday.—The cook scolded the baker for at least five minutes. I’ll be whipped if
                  that woman does not drink. </p>
               <p>A coach with a mitre came about two, with a fine looking man of a bishop. I’ll be
                  shot if I should not like to be confirmed by him. How come Fusty Bonham to be
                  acquainted with a bishop?—He must be some distant relation; for we saw him very
                  plainly in the drawing room, take the two children upon his knees, and fondle
                  them. He must be a good-natured, delightful man! O heavens, how I do wish to be
                  confirmed by him! Looked into Debrett’s Peerage, to see the coats of arms of the
                  bishops, to discover who he is: found him to be an Irish bishop. O dear
                  heart!—well I do think that I would go to Ireland to be confirmed by him.—He staid
                  two hours.—I’ll be hanged if I have not found it out:--Fusty Bonham is an
                  Irishman.--Mem. Mrs. B------’s woman talked with the bishop’s servant for three
                  quarters of an hour, by our clock, through the rails of the area. She had a word
                  or two also for the coachman; but she has a word or two for any body. </p>
               <p>”Tuesday.—Nobody called this morning but a milliner with a bandbox. She looked as
                  if she did not like to leave it without the money. About three, a lady arrived in
                  a handsome post-chaise and four, with a woman servant and two outriders.—On
                  entering the drawingroom, how Fusty Bonham did kiss her! and then he drew the
                  curtains. The pot-boy at the Dragon says, it is Bonham’s sister, arrived from
                  Yorkshire: but I will not believe it; brothers don’t kiss sisters in that way. </p>
               <p>”Wednesday.—Mem. Neither butcher, nor butterer, nor fishmonger, has called at the
                  B------‘s this week. They have of course been living for these three days on the
                  remains of Sunday’s dinner. Some people may be satisfied with a good dinner once a
                  week, so that they ride in their coach the other six.” </p>
               <p>I shall trouble you, Mr. Spectator, with no more of this curious manuscript. But,
                  without suffering my comforts to be affected by such ignorant and worthless
                  people, I cannot help considering their conduct as a nuisance, which ought to be
                  removed. Now, as there is no method of presenting them by a grand jury, suffer me
                  to present them in this manner to you; and I am confident that you will receive
                  the acknowledgments of many others besides those of </p>
               <p>Your obliged, humble servant,</p>
               <p>Augustus Bonham</p>
               <p>I cannot, Mr. Spectator, resist calling your further attention to a circumstance
                  which took place within a couple of hours after I had written the rough draft of
                  the foregoing letter. </p>
               <p>Being in my laboratory, pursuing some chemical experiments, a smart young man was
                  introduced to me on the part of the Quicksights. He stated, that he lately made
                  acquaintance with that respectable family, and had a very tender interest in the
                  happiness and honour of the young ladies, by one of whom he was received as a
                  lover; and that she had been very much insulted and distressed by one of my
                  servants, who, from one of the upper windows in my house, had exposed a part of
                  himself which ought to be kicked as long as a foot could be found to kick it. In
                  short, he came to inform me, that he was an attorney, and had received
                  instructions from Mr. Quicksight to proceed against me. I knew nothing of what had
                  happened, and assured him, it was without my approbation or connivance; at the
                  same time, I did not hesitate to observe, that the continual gazing and
                  inquisitive faces of the Quicksight family from every window in their house, was
                  equally unpleasant to me; I also added, that it would be a curious question for a
                  court of law to determine—what parts of the human body it was illegal to expose
                  from a window, as eyes might be as offensive as any other portion of it. He said,
                  he loved Miss Wilhelmina Quicksight, and would not suffer her to be insulted while
                  he had power to take out a writ in her defense. I observed, that he certainly
                  proved himself a very fond and generous lover, as the first present he made to the
                  lady and her family, was that which he most valued himself, a litigious and
                  expensive suit at law. My gentleman was now beginning to be impertinent, when, as
                  I was about my chemical process, by which I could, without any danger, cause a
                  considerable explosion, I immediately produced a very serious bounce; when the
                  attorney instantly burst out of the room, darted through the street door,
                  overturned a baker’s basket into the dirt, tumbled himself into the kennel, and
                  sought, amidst filth and fear, the condolence and cleansing attention of Miss
                  Wilhelmina Quicksight. Of the threatened prosecution I have heard nothing, but I
                  understand that the baker has summoned the attorney to the court of conscience for
                  the injury done to his bread. </p>
