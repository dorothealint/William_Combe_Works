               <p>O rus, quando ego te aspiciam, quandoque licebit,</p>
               
               <p>Ducere solicitae jucunda oblivia vitae?</p>
               <p>VIRG. </p>
               
               <p>Whenshall I to the shades retire,</p>
               
               <p>And bid adieu to worldly care;</p>
               
               <p>The country’s tranquil charms admire,</p>
               
               <p>And find the peace that’s treasur’d there&gt;</p>
               
               <p> It may, I believe, be said with great truth, that no one was ever engaged in the
                  bustle and
                  business of life, who did not look to some future period, with a satisfactory expectation,
                  when he should retire from its cares and anxieties to the enjoyment of peace and
                  tranquillity. But of the numbers who have entertained such pleasing hopes, the greater
                  part
                  have not, I fear, obtained the flattering object. Misfortune too often renders the
                  design
                  abortive; infirmities frequently annihilate the desire of enjoying it; while worldly
                  interests and rooted habits detain no small portion of them from carrying their purpose
                  into
                  execution, till the hour arrives when the landscape of life is fading before them.
                  But this
                  is not all:—-how few of those who live to accomplish the project, find it a scene
                  of
                  contentment!
               </p>
               
               <p>A man who retires from the active concerns of life, must carry something more along
                  with him,
                  than the money sufficient to purchase the accommodations which he had fancied would
                  give all
                  the agreeableness he expected from his new situation. He must take a mind stored with
                  something more than a sense of his prosperity, or a recollection of the fortunate
                  circumstances and active industry which combined to acquire it. When the change is
                  so great,
                  as to be from the anxious occupation of every moment to the having nothing to do,
                  from full
                  employment to vacant hours, there must be some preparatory power to preserve the mind,
                  not
                  merely from listlessness, but, I might almost say, from misery; and that such precious
                  attainments are not always possessed by those who have been the fabricators of their
                  own
                  fortunes, especially when trade and commerce have formed the scene of their activity,
                  no
                  one, I believe, will venture to controvert. Rural occupations, country society, and
                  provincial duties, differ so much from their accustomed habits and pursuits, that
                  they do
                  not readily enjoy the one, as they are very rarely, if ever, qualified to perform
                  the
                  other.
               </p>
               
               <p>It may be also observed, that those who have been accustomed to live altogether in
                  the
                  metropolis, and have, consequently, formed their notions of life from the manners
                  and
                  occupations of its inhabitants, are disposed to make pleasing pictures, in their own
                  minds,
                  of the tranquil enjoyments and amiable simplicity of those who have always lived in
                  the
                  country, which a practical experience of them will soon destroy. The vices which disgrace
                  the human character, and the passions that disturb it, though they may appear in a
                  new and
                  less prominent state, will be found sufficient, in the remotest village, to disperse
                  the
                  fancied dreams of rural virtue and pastoral innocence.
               </p>
               
               <p>These thoughts have been suggested by a letter which I have received from the country,
                  and
                  which I shall, without any further observation, present to my readers.
               </p>
               
               <p>TO THE MODERN SPECTATOR. Sir, </p>
               <p>As you have invited correspondents, I beg leave to
                  become one of them. The history of my perplexities may not perhaps be unamusing; as,
                  had
                  they happened to another, they would probably have been entertaining to myself.
               </p>
               
               <p>A life of commercial business had confined me to London and its immediate
                  vicinity, till, by the death of a very wealthy relation, I found myself in possession
                  of
                  a fortune, which set me above the desire of making any addition to it; and determined
                  me
                  to get rid of all my trading concerns, in order that I might pass the rest of my days
                  in
                  the enjoyment of every rational pleasure that my added riches could procure me.
               </p>
               
               <p>In the occasional intervals of business, I had frequently felt an anxious desire to
                  see
                  the distant parts of England; and had, from year to year, intended to
                  accept the kind invitations of some relations in the country, which used to accompany
                  the turkies, chines, and hampers of game, they occasionally sent me. But the necessary
                  leisure never arrived; nor do I know when I should have found the expected opportunity,
                  if the last will and testament of my deceased uncle had not presented it to me.
               </p>
               
               <p>Having, in a few months, disentangled myself from all my commercial engagements, I
                  wrote
                  to my relation, Sir Wm. Overhill, to inform him of my intention to
                  pay him the long-promised visit, and waited with a school-boy's impatience for the
                  day
                  when I was to turn my back upon London, in search, as it were, of a new
                  life, and, as yet, untasted pleasures, in a distant part of the kingdom.
               </p>
               
               <p>My journey was one continued scene of delightful variety. The manufacturing towns
                  through
                  which I passed, being in some degree connected with my former profession, had a natural
                  claim to my attention. The navigable river, the verdant pasture, and expanding harvest,
                  were not unfamiliar to my commercial reflections: but the mountain, the hanging wood,
                  the jutting rock, and the roaring water-fall, awakened sensations of pleasure as yet
                  unknown to me, and of which I was delighted to find myself susceptible. The bold
                  abruptness of nature I had never before seen but in the representation of the
                  painter.
               </p>
               
               <p>Glowing with these impressions, panting after new objects of delight, and eager to
                  see a
                  part of my family I had not seen for many years, I arrived at the entrance of the
                  stately old avenue which led to the mansion of my country cousin.
               </p>
               
               <p>As I was hourly expected, the servants were on the watch to give notice of my approach,
                  and when my chaise reached the door, I found the old Gothic porch filled with the
                  family, who were ready to receive me with all those respectful attentions which so
                  near
                  and so wealthy a relation might be supposed to deserve.
               </p>
               
               <p>On my descending from the chaise, Sir William received me with a look of real
                  satisfaction; and having almost dislocated my wrist, by the hearty shake of the hand
                  with which he welcomed me, he presented me to his lady, who concluded many expressions
                  of regard, by saying, "that long-look'd-for was come at last." She then ordered her
                  three daughters to come forward and salute their London cousin. The young ladies,
                  indeed, did not seem so bashful as I expected from a country education, but concluding
                  that their unembarrassed reception of my embrace arose from their joy to see me, I
                  checked the rising surprise.
               </p>
               
               <p>It was about seven in the evening; and, on my mentioning tea as the refreshment most
                  agreable [sic] to me, Sir William's countenance seemed not to possess all the
                  approbation which would probably have accompanied my proposal for a bowl of punch
                  or a
                  bottle of wine. The tea-table, however, soon made its appearance, and my three fair
                  cousins were hardly constrained by my presence from engaging in a very unpleasant
                  contest about the honour of preparing the regale which I had requested. It was, however,
                  determined by the mother, that Peggy, who was her favourite, should perform the
                  ceremony; while her two sisters sat in malignant sulkiness, watching her motions,
                  and
                  ridiculing her civilities to me, and whispering their wishes, that the tea-pot might
                  fall from her hand, or the boiling water be poured upon it.
               </p>
               
               <p>I took my beverage without appearing to observe the little hostilities which were
                  passing
                  around me: and continued answering the reiterated questions of the baronet and his
                  lady,
                  till 1 became quite exhausted, and was on the point of desiring to be conducted to
                  my
                  chamber, when supper was announced; and I was ushered into a large adjoining room,
                  where
                  a banquet was prepared that would have satisfied the hungry expectation of gluttony
                  itself.
               </p>
               
               <p>Instead of that rest which I so much wanted, I was forced to a meal of which I had
                  no
                  appetite to partake; and though I resisted, with all the politeness I was capable
                  of
                  exerting, the various recommendations of the good things placed before me, I was so
                  far
                  obliged to comply with the hospitable solicitations, that I retired at a late hour
                  to my
                  chamber, with a loaded stomach, and found my servant so completely inebriated as to
                  be
                  totally disqualified from any one act of his usual duty. In this situation I passed
                  a
                  restless night; and at an early hour of the morning, when nature, after the struggles
                  of
                  indigestion, was yielding to repose, I was disturbed by Sir
                  William's entrance into my chamber, in order to conduct me to the stable and
                  the dog-kennel.
               </p>
               
               <p>This invitation, which was intended as a civility, I knew not how to resist, and I
                  obeyed
                  with the best grace in my power: when, after having been deafened with the noise of
                  dogs, and poisoned with the smell of horse-flesh, 1 was hurried to the stable to take
                  a
                  view of the stud, and to be particularly instructed in all the merits of a famous
                  race-horse; who, from my want of caution in approaching too near him, was within a
                  few
                  inches of kicking me out of existence.
               </p>
               
               <p>We now retreated to coffee, tea, and chocolate, with hot loaves soaked in butter,
                  and the
                  teasing civilities of my rival cousins. The moment the breakfast was over I was hurried
                  round a large park, and rowed about a large lake of water, beneath the scorching
                  influence of a meridian sun: in short, every day brought a hurry of entertainments
                  along
                  with it; and what with visiting and receiving visits, attending horse-races and
                  assemblies, with jaunts to shew me the country, during the six weeks I had promised
                  to
                  stay with this family, I scarce had a moment I could call my own; and often did I
                  long
                  to be restored to the quiet of my little garden at Clapham, where, after
                  the fatigues of business, I was wont to find that tranquillity which I have now sought
                  in vain at a hundred and fifty miles distance from the capital.
               </p>
               
               <p>But my country history ends not here: for I found that this family, where I had expected
                  to find the plain unassuming virtues of a provincial life, was an epitome of the
                  fashionable busy world; and that not only the London fashions, but some of its
                  dissipations, to say no worse, were to be seen at Overhill Hall. The
                  baronet himself let me into the secret of a little dairy-maid, who was very pretty
                  and
                  very kind; while the good lady, his wife, was never so happy as when Mr.
                  Sturdy, the curate, came to read a new novel to her on a rainy morning.
                  My young cousins have each of them a secret lover; and the youngest, with all her
                  family
                  pride, would certainly have decamped with a young apothecary in the neighbourhood,
                  if I
                  had not been accidentally in the way to prevent such a miserable expedition.
               </p>
               
               <p>Envy, scandal, and calumny seem to be as well understood there, and as liberally
                  practised, as in the metropolis. In short, I rejoiced that the term of my visit was
                  concluded; and when I took leave of my hospitable relations, for hospitable they were,
                  1
                  seemed to find tranquillity on a turnpike road and in a public inn.
               </p>
               
               <p>I am your obedient servant,</p>
